    "job_description": "Impinj is a leading RAIN RFID provider and Internet of Things pioneer. We're inventing ways to connect every thing to the Internet — including retail apparel, retail general merchandise, healthcare items, automobile parts, airline baggage, food and much more. With more than 100 billion items connected to date, and multiple Fortune 500 enterprises around the world using our platform, we solve for a better understanding of our world. If it's a thing, we're working to connect it. Join Impinj and help us realize our vision of a boundless IoT— connecting trillions of everyday items to the Internet.\n\nTeam Overview:\n\nImpinj is seeking a full-stack SaaS and IoT Software Engineering Intern to join our Enterprise Solutions team. We're building the next-generation platform that makes RAIN RFID technology accessible to businesses of all sizes, from healthcare to logistics to retail. Our work spans cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, real-time data processing, IoT device management, and developer tools.\n\nToday, customers who want to run custom code on Impinj readers must cross-compile ARM binaries, manage complex deployment pipelines, and navigate low-level system interfaces. It is powerful but requires expertise on multiple fronts and significant developer investment. Your mission: make it radically easier.\n\nYou will design and build an edge compute package that integrates with our cloud-based fleet management platform. Instead of wrestling with ELF binaries and cross-compilation toolchains, customers will write code in a high-level language, use an intuitive API to access reader functions, and deploy with a click. You'll lead this end-to-end, from runtime design to cloud integration, and deliver a working proof-of-concept by the end of summer.\n\nThis is a lighthouse project. If it works, it changes how we think about customer development experience and could shape our product roadmap.\nWhat You Will Do:\n• Design and implement an edge compute runtime that lets customers write reader applications in a high-level language\n• Build the supporting cloud infrastructure: bundle build/CI/CD, deployment, versioning, and rollback\n• Create an intuitive API that exposes reader functions to the runtime, with clear documentation\n• Integrate with our fleet management platform for configuration, deployment, and state reporting\n• Build UI components for code management in the admin console\n• Work directly with Product Management and the SVP of Engineering to translate product vision into technical implementation\n• Characterize and optimize performance: CPU, binary size, network usage, and memory footprint\n• Deliver a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates a radically simpler developer experience\nWhat You Will Bring:\n• Currently enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's program in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or similar program\n• We care less about credentials and more about what you've built. Show us impressive coursework, side projects, open-source contributions, or anything else that proves you can write good software and solve hard problems. Experience with low level languages like C/C++/Rust in resource constrained environments.\n• You take initiative, work independently, and find ways to overcome obstacles. Showcase your side projects or open-source contributions\n• You're genuinely excited about building things; you ask good questions, dig into how things work, and bring enthusiasm to the team.\n• Solid grasp of computer science basics, but also software development best practices. You thrive in close collaboration, communicate clearly, and know how to get stuff done on a team\n• This project has design, product, and business strategy dimensions. We want someone who's interested in those considerations and can integrate them into technical decisions\nWhy Intern with Impinj:\n\nThe Impinj Summer Internship Program is designed to provide undergraduate and graduate students with a comprehensive learning experience that goes beyond traditional work assignments. It offers a unique blend of professional development, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help interns thrive in their roles and prepare for successful careers. Students develop valuable skills through interactive learning sessions and receive personalized mentorship and guidance from early-career colleagues.\n\nThe program offers more than just a resume boost. It's a chance to access hands-on experience, leadership insights, and a network of peers and mentors that lasts well beyond the summer.\n\nLearn what our interns last year had to say about their experience: Impinj Intern Program: A Season of Learning, Connection, and Fun (Impinj blog).\n\nThis Summer Internship Cohort begins on Monday, June 15 and ends September 4. The start date is firm; the end date is flexible to end early. All internship positions report at least on a hybrid basis to our Seattle office. There is opportunity for full time employment for those graduates or those entering their senior year.\n\nCompensation & Benefits:\n\nThe benefits listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with Impinj and the country where you work.\n\nThe typical base pay range for this role across the US is $26.00/hr - $40.00/hr. Individual base pay depends on various factors such as complexity and responsibility of role, job duties, requirements, and relevant experience and skills. Both market wage data and the mid-point of the pay range is reviewed and used as the starting point for all new hire offers. Offers are made within the base pay range applicable at the time.\n\nAt Impinj certain roles are eligible for additional rewards, including merit increases, annual bonus and stock. These awards are allocated based on individual performance. In addition, certain roles also have the opportunity to earn sales incentives based on revenue or utilization, depending on the terms of the plan and the employee's role.

With a culture that’s all in on impact, innovation, and collaboration, Snowflake is the sweet spot for building big, moving fast, and taking technology — and careers — to the next level.\n\nThe Snowflake Openflow team is building Snowflake’s next-generation open, extensible, and secure data integration platform for real-time, scalable, bi-directional data movement, powered by Apache NiFi. We enable customers to move structured and multi-modal unstructured data across any source and any sink—Snowflake and non-Snowflake alike—through a single, cloud-native platform that supports batch and streaming, and flexible runtimes spanning Snowflake-managed (SPCS) and Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) data planes.\n\nOur team includes original creators and core contributors to Apache NiFi and industry leaders in data integration, now focused on bringing NiFi’s proven strengths—visual flows, rich connectors, and powerful routing—to Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud at enterprise scale. We work end to end across high-performance runtimes, and curated connectors, partnering closely with product, field, and open-source communities to help customers continuously ingest data, power AI and analytics workloads, and make smarter decisions in real time.\n\nAS A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER ON THE SNOWFLAKE OPENFLOW TEAM, YOU WILL:\n• Design and implement features in Openflow’s control plane and data plane, contributing to reliable, scalable, and secure services that power real-time, bi-directional data movement for our customers.\n• Build and evolve distributed systems for batch and streaming workloads, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data pipelines across Snowflake and non-Snowflake environments, for both structured and multi-modal unstructured data.\n• Own medium-sized projects end to end—from requirements clarification and technical design through implementation, testing, rollout, and follow-up improvements—with appropriate guidance from Staff and Principal engineers.\n• Take operational ownership of the components you build, including monitoring, on-call participation, incident response, and contributing to post-incident reviews and reliability improvements.\n• Apply and promote solid engineering practices in your area—clean code, robust testing, observability, security, and documentation—to keep our platform easy to operate and evolve.\n• Collaborate closely with peers across engineering, product, and design, translating ambiguous requirements into clear technical plans, breaking work into milestones, and communicating progress and risks.\n• Analyze and improve performance, scalability, and reliability of existing services and pipelines, using metrics, profiling, and experimentation to guide optimizations.\n• Mentor junior engineers and interns, providing constructive code reviews, design feedback, and sharing domain knowledge in Openflow, Snowflake, and distributed systems.\n• Contribute to shared platform tooling and patterns, helping make it easier for Openflow teams to build, deploy, and operate high-quality connectors and runtimes.\n\nOUR IDEAL SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER WILL HAVE:\n• 7+ years of industry experience building and operating backend or platform services, including significant hands-on work with distributed systems.\n• Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms, data structures, and systems design, with the ability to apply them pragmatically in production code.\n• Practical experience with distributed systems concepts, such as concurrency, replication, partitioning, streaming, and fault tolerance, and how they impact correctness, performance, and operability.\n• Solid understanding of operating systems and networking basics, including multi-threading, memory management, storage, and debugging performance/scale issues.\n• Proficiency in Java or a similar object-oriented language (e.g., Scala, Go, C++), and experience working in large, shared codebases.\n• Experience building cloud-native services on at least one major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP), using containers, CI/CD, and modern monitoring/logging stacks.\n• A track record of delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions to non-trivial engineering problems, balancing speed with long-term reliability and simplicity.\n• Strong collaboration and communication skills, with the ability to work effectively with teammates across locations, give and receive feedback, and explain technical trade-offs clearly.\n• BS in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent practical experience building and shipping distributed systems.\n• (Bonus) Experience with data integration, observability, or streaming/flow technologies (e.g., Apache NiFi, Kafka, Flink, Airflow, or similar) or with analytics/data platforms.\n\nEvery Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company’s confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data. Snowflake employees must abide by the company’s data security plan as an essential part of their duties. It is every employee's duty to keep customer information secure and confidential.\n\nSnowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.\n\nHow do you want to make your impact?\n\nFor jobs located in the United States, please visit the job posting on the Snowflake Careers Site for salary and benefits information: careers.snowflake.com\n\nThe following represents the expected range of compensation for this role:\n• The estimated base salary range for this role is $200,000 - $287,500.\n• Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Snowflake’s bonus and equity plan.\n\nThe successful candidate’s starting salary will be determined based on permissible, non-discriminatory factors such as skills, experience, and geographic location.
