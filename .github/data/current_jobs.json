At Overstory, we're harnessing cutting-edge technology to enable a resilient electrical grid that keeps communities thriving as our world changes.\n\nThe grid is the backbone of life as we know it. It powers hospitals, keeps food fresh, and ensures communities stay connected. But extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and growing wildfire risks are putting this critical system under pressure. All of this combined makes the electric utility industry the greatest opportunity for tackling climate change.\n\nOne of the leading causes of catastrophic wildfires and power outages? Trees and brush coming into contact with power lines.\n\nThat's where we help. At Overstory, we use AI and advanced satellite imagery to pinpoint and prioritize vegetation risks before they materialize. By giving utilities critical analysis on those risks, we're helping prevent outages, reduce wildfire risks, and accelerate the transition to a safer, more resilient grid.\n\nOur team spans the Americas and Europe, and we work with utility partners across the Americas and beyond. We're outdoor enthusiasts, musicians, artists, athletes, parents, and adventurers-15 nationalities strong and growing. What unites us is a passion for solving complex problems, a commitment to climate action, and the belief that technology should be a force for good.\n\nJoin us to help us build a more resilient world together.\n\nThe role\n\nAs a Senior Software Engineer, you will work on one of our web product teams that enables utility companies to more effectively manage risks associated with climate change, wildfires and storms.\n\nYou will work as part of a cross functional product team working closely with product managers, designers and tech leads to build products that our customers love.\nWhat you will do\n\nOver the next 6-12 months you will be working on:\n• Performance & Scalability: ensure that our product can handle 3x YoY growth\n• Accelerate time to value of new product capabilities\n• Reduce the amount of manual work required to ingest vegetation analysis into our customer facing applications\n\nYou will be an influential member of the team taking the lead on and contributing to key initiatives. Additionally you will coach and mentor other engineers on the team.\nAbout You\n• Based in GMT/CET or US-East time zone (core to our team's ability to overlap and successfully collaborate)\n• Proven experience of full stack development across the following (or similar) technologies: React/Typescript, Python/fastAPI, Postgres DB, Data pipelines). We are looking for generalists that are backend leaning.\n• Comfortable working in a build it, run it environment (GCP, cloud run, grafana, k8s) - or similar\n• Passionate about climate\n• Experience working in a high growth scaleup environment\n• Product minded and able to demonstrate significant impact you have had on a business through the application of technology\n• Ability to design and implement scalable and resilient systems\n• Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively in a cross-functional team environment\n• Committed to ongoing education, perpetual learning; interested in evolving technologies and industry trends.\nNice to haves\n• Experience working with maps/imagery/geospatial domains\n\nIf you don't meet all of the above yet feel you have lots to offer, please apply anyway.\nWhat we offer\n• Base salary and equity that aligns with geo-specific market data\n• Flexible working environment with a lot of autonomy. We build our work days around our lives, not the other way around\n• A remote working stipend, ongoing educational budget\n• To be surrounded by an excellent, vibrant, smart team who have each other's back and believe in a culture of openness, tolerance and respect\n• To be part of truly mission-driven work that reduces wildfires, protects earth's natural resources and helps solve our climate crisis\n\nAbout our team\n\nWe are a group of 100 people from all over the world. Fifteen nationalities are represented in our team. We work remotely from eleven different countries and we are looking for candidates that are also living and working in one of these countries: United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Estonia, Portugal, France, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Canada. We meet up once a year in-person for our unforgettable team gathering event. We also offer the option to occasionally meet up for in-person collaboration.\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nWe place enormous value on diversity and inclusion and strive to continually bring in people of all genders, races, creeds, ethnicities, abilities and backgrounds. We believe that the best ideas emerge when people with different perspectives and approaches work together on a problem.\n\nWe're always looking to diversify our team further, but we're proud of the fact that four out of the nine people on our leadership team are female, 46% of the overall team are female and 20% of the team are people of color. Our team speaks fifteen languages: English, Dutch, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Luxembourgish, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, Cantonese, Estonian, Danish and Korean.\nOur values\nTackling the climate crisis is our greatest mission.\n\nWe act with urgency.\nOur curiosity fuels our growth.\n\nWe recognize that change is constant, and we find joy and power in exploration.\nWe're rooted in diversity.\n\nJust as ecosystems need biodiversity to thrive, our resiliency comes from our differences.\nWe care for each other.\n\nWe love the power of machines but we nurture each other as humans.\nTrust is fundamental.\n\nWe assume the best in everyone, and we share ideas openly so that we have a positive impact.\n\nUse of AI in Our Hiring Process\n\nWe sometimes use AI tools to support parts of our hiring process, such as helping us manage applications more efficiently or ensuring job descriptions are clear and inclusive.
