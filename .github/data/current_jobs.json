What You'll Do: Redesign existing React Native app to support bilingual/multilingual UI (Spanish, English, French). Implement internationalization (i18n) using libraries like react-i18next. Refactor the app to be parametric and flexible, allowing configuration-driven questions and XLS mappings. Enhance XLS file handling (import/export) with robust validation and formatting. Improve UI/UX for dynamic forms and responsive design. Write clean, maintainable, secure, and well-documented code. Implement unit tests for XLS logic and language switching. Collaborate with stakeholders to gather requirements and propose technical solutions. Design a road map and training materials to implement in microfinance institutions (MFIs) operating across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe with different IT ecosystems. Why Join Us Global Team Collaboration: Join a diverse global audit team comprising professionals from various cultural backgrounds with expertise in microfinance, data analytics, audit and assurance, finance, accounting, and fraud. The intern will also collaborate with IT departments at the Global Centre and across our MFIs. Benefit from their enthusiasm for coaching and mentoring.
