And you'll build relationships and help drive adoption through tools, documentation, and collaboration.\nRemote Work Qualifications\n• Access to a reliable and secure high-speed internet connection.

The base of Clark’s success comes from four key directives: Hiring great people, creating value for customers, and investing in employees and their communities. These pillars drive each of Clark Associates’ multi-million-dollar businesses forward, including WebstaurantStore and other industry-leading names like 11400, Clark Food Service Equipment, The Restaurant Store, and Clark National Accounts.\n\nAre You Ready?\n\nEntrepreneurial Spirit is the driving force behind WebstaurantStore’s work environment. Making things better for our customers is our goal every single day. Achieving that goal means taking risks, accepting failure, and learning from our mistakes. If that sounds like a mission you’re ready to be a part of, we’d love to discuss this role with you further, and we’re excited to meet you!\n\nNever heard of us? That’s okay! We love sharing our stories.\n• WebstaurantStore | About Us\n• Video Message from Leadership\n• Clark Associates Timeline [Parent Company]\n\nCheck us out on:\n• LinkedIn\n• Instagram\n• Facebook\n• YouTube\n• TikTok\n• Pinterest\n• X/Twitter",

    "job_description": "About The Company:\n\nAt Scribd Inc. (pronounced “scribbed”), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our four products: Everand, Scribd, Slideshare, and Fable.\n\nThis posting reflects an approved, open position within the organization.\n\nWe support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.\n\nWhen it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd Inc. employees, regardless of their location.\n\nSo what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd Inc., we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here’s what that means for you: we’re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve Goals, achieve Results within their job responsibilities, contribute Innovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader Team through collaboration and attitude.\n\nAbout the Discovery Applications Team\n\nDiscovery Applications is the face of Scribd’s Machine Learning and Discovery Engineering Division. It is dedicated to building the customer-facing web experiences that power our cutting-edge search, recommendations, and generative AI features. This full stack team builds and owns the end-to-end discovery experience across Scribd and Everand, turning machine learning capabilities into intuitive, customer-facing features.\n\nJoining this team means you will play a key role in delivering the user value of the pioneering machine learning work, creating tangible impacts through exceptional user experiences.\n\nAs a Frontend Engineer on Discovery Applications\n\nOur cross-functional squads often involve deep collaboration with other engineering teams, designers, and product managers. Your excellent communication, both in meetings and asynchronously via slack will be a key tool in driving success.\n\nThis role predominantly focuses on the frontend but comfort and knowledge of the full tech stack is a must as this role works closely with backend and ML engineers to build our complete product. You will build the user-facing experiences that are powered by Machine Learning and Generative AI.\n\nFull-cycle software development will be your primary function, but we'll expect you to contribute in a number of ways, including advising on others' technical design, reviewing code, participating in interviews, and mentoring less experienced engineers.\n\nWhen you are building software, you'll be doing more than just coding a ticket that is handed to you. You'll contribute to the code strategy, architecture, implementation, delivery, and operation of systems, end-to-end. You'll consider testability, upgradeability, scalability, and observability throughout the development process.\n\nMust Have Skills and Experience\n• 3–5 years building and shipping customer-facing frontend applications with React and TypeScript\n• Strong grasp of modern frontend fundamentals: state management, component architecture, accessibility, testing, and UI quality\n• Experience integrating frontends with APIs (REST/GraphQL) and comfort working in a Rails-backed product environment\n• Ability to build high-quality interactive experiences (including real-time/streaming UI patterns) with attention to UX polish\n• Strong understanding of web performance (profiling, bundling, rendering, caching) and a track record of improving it in production\n• Comfortable working in a codebase with shared patterns (monorepos, shared UI libraries, or platform constraints) and collaborating across teams\n• Excellent written and verbal communication; thrives in a remote, documentation-driven culture\n• Highly collaborative: partners closely with product, design, and backend to deliver end-to-end features\n\nNice to Have Skills and Experience\n• Excited to build AI-powered product experiences end-to-end (0 1 prototyping, rapid iteration, and shipping to production).\n• Experience designing search, recommendations, and discovery UX (relevance, ranking, personalization, evaluation).\n• Familiarity with LLM/AI integrations in web apps (streaming UIs, prompt/tool patterns, human-in-the-loop workflows).\n• Experience with Next.js, GraphQL, and modern frontend architecture patterns.\n• Built or evolved a design system / component library that enables fast, consistent product delivery.\n• Comfort operating in high-traffic, high-visibility environments with real customer impact.\n• Ability to diagnose and improve performance, caching, and observability in modern web applications.\n\nAt Scribd, your base pay is one part of your total compensation package and is determined within a range. Our pay ranges are based on the local cost of labor benchmarks for each specific role, level, and geographic location. San Francisco is our highest geographic market in the United States. In the state of California, the reasonably expected salary range is between $146,000 [minimum salary in our lowest geographic market within California] to $227,500 [maximum salary in our highest geographic market within California].\n\nIn the United States, outside of California, the reasonably expected salary range is between $120,000 [minimum salary in our lowest US geographic market outside of California] to $216,500 [maximum salary in our highest US geographic market outside of California].\n\nIn Canada, the reasonably expected salary range is between $152,500 CAD[minimum salary in our lowest geographic market] to $194,500 CAD[maximum salary in our highest geographic market].\n\nWe carefully consider a wide range of factors when determining compensation, including but not limited to experience; job-related skill sets; relevant education or training; and other business and organizational needs. The salary range listed is for the level at which this job has been scoped. In the event that you are considered for a different level, a higher or lower pay range would apply.

CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 to fix a fundamental problem: The sophisticated attacks that were forcing the world’s leading businesses into the headlines could not be solved with existing malware-based defenses. Founder George Kurtz realized that a brand new approach was needed — one that combines the most advanced endpoint protection with expert intelligence to pinpoint the adversaries perpetrating the attacks, not just the malware. There’s much more to the story of how Falcon has redefined endpoint protection but there’s only one thing to remember about CrowdStrike: We stop breaches.",
