    "job_description": "GiveCampus is the world's leading fundraising platform for non-profit educational institutions. Trusted by 1,300+ colleges, universities, and K-12 schools, our mission is to help advance the quality, the affordability, and the accessibility of education. We received a seed investment from Y Combinator in 2015 and have pursued a strategy of 'Sustainable Growth' ever since: achieving six consecutive years of profitability and positive cash-flow while more than quadrupling our revenue, our customer base, and our team. In 2022, we raised $50 million to accelerate the next stage of our growth.\n\nThrough The GiveCampus Social Mobility Initiative, we've donated $1 million in free fundraising support for programs that help low-income students, first-generation students, and underrepresented minorities. And in 2022 and 2023, we were named to Y Combinator's Top Companies list and the Inc. 5000 list of America's fastest-growing private companies.\n\nWhile we operate at meaningful scale (we've facilitated more than $6 billion in charitable giving), we're still small relative to the commercial and social good opportunities in front of us. Every GiveCampus employee has a substantial impact on our trajectory, and we're growing to help schools achieve even greater results.\n\nOur purpose-driven team of 120+ is located across the US: team members work from anywhere they choose. We have a beautiful 12,000 sf office in Washington, DC that is available for people to use whenever they want, and we regularly organize team meet-ups, events, and retreats in various locations. We're looking to expand our team with diverse and collaborative doers who believe in our mission and the transformative power of affordable, high-quality education.\n\nLocation: This is a remote-first role based in the U.S. While we embrace flexible, distributed work, we also value in-person connection. Team members are expected to attend multiple company-wide and team-specific onsites throughout the year.\n\nWe are hiring a Senior Software Engineer, Finance & Business Systems who is excited to work deeply embedded in the business — not siloed in a traditional engineering-only org. As GiveCampus scales, we need a deeper understanding of the true cost to serve our customers — across product usage, infrastructure, payments, support, and internal operations and fixing the system to reduce friction for our customers. This role exists to sit at the intersection of Finance, Engineering, and Operations, building the systems and instrumentation that make our unit economics visible, trustworthy, and actionable.\n\nThis role is ideal for a Rails engineer who wants to apply strong technical skills in close partnership with Finance, Operations, and Engineering leadership, and who is motivated by solving real operational problems rather than working exclusively from a product roadmap. This is not a traditional product engineering role. It is a deeply business-embedded engineering role with real leverage on how the company operates and scales.\n\nResponsibilities will include:\n• Working on the full stack, from UI elements to backend services including getting into database tuning and performance.\n• Iterating quickly, building new features from start to finish and back end to front end, including architecture design, coding, automated testing, and supporting each implementation in production.\n• Being adaptable - working closely with and supporting your teammates in a fast-paced, agile development environment (both within your pod and across Engineering as a whole).\n• Tackling a wide variety of technical issues throughout our stack and contributing to all parts of the code base and shared documentation.\n• Contributing to team-wide initiatives including coding standards, tech debt refinement and system security monitoring.\n• Participating in the interviewing and onboarding new team members and assisting in the refinement of our interviewing processes.\n• Participating in the support of the platform on a rotational basis (team-based support and paired, on-call rotation).\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n• Strong experience with Ruby on Rails or another mature MVC framework (e.g., Django). System design experience with a focus on architecting solutions that can be implemented incrementally while keeping an eye towards scale and resilience.\n• Comfort working across the stack, including backend services, databases, and light frontend work.\n• Experience with modern front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js.\n• SQL database experience (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).\n• Experience with deployments to Heroku, AWS, or similar.\n• Experience balancing swift and long-term code maintainability.\n• 5 plus years of hands-on development experience.\n• Comfort working with financial concepts such as margins, COGS, pricing, revenue recognition, or unit economics (direct experience or strong interest).\n• Experience building systems where correctness, auditability, and explainability matter.\n• Ability to work with non-technical stakeholders and translate ambiguous business questions into concrete technical work.\n• Ability to handle ambiguity and shaping the problem, not just the solution.\n\nBonus points if you have:\n• Deep expertise with Ruby/Ruby on Rails and RSpec.\n• Experience with Postgres database administration.\n• Shipped code that has supported tens of thousands of users, including enterprise/business customers.\n• Operations experience and how it pertains to site reliability/speed.\n• Familiarity with networking, caching, database, and how to triage performance and stability issues.\n• Experience working on a fundraising/crowdfunding platform.\n• Experience working on a fintech or payments technology product.\n• Experience working in a start up environment\n• A good eye for intuitive, user-friendly front end design.\n• Experience building internal tools or platforms used by Finance or Operations teams\nReady to apply?\n\nBe sure to keep an eye on your spam and promotions boxes in case our emails end up there!\n\nAt GiveCampus, we value diversity and we pledge to foster an environment of support, inclusivity, and learning, both on the job and throughout the application process. In this spirit, we encourage candidates of all backgrounds to apply.\n\nGiveCampus is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Applicants and employees are not discriminated against because of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion, national origin, citizenship status, disability, ancestry, marital status, veteran status, medical condition or any protected category prohibited by local, state or federal laws.\n\nIf you feel like you don't meet all of the requirements for this role, please apply anyways. We know confidence gaps and imposter syndrome often get in the way of connecting with incredible people, and we don't want them to prevent us from meeting you.",

    "job_description": "Impinj is a leading RAIN RFID provider and Internet of Things pioneer. We're inventing ways to connect every thing to the Internet — including retail apparel, retail general merchandise, healthcare items, automobile parts, airline baggage, food and much more. With more than 100 billion items connected to date, and multiple Fortune 500 enterprises around the world using our platform, we solve for a better understanding of our world. If it's a thing, we're working to connect it. Join Impinj and help us realize our vision of a boundless IoT— connecting trillions of everyday items to the Internet.\n\nTeam Overview:\n\nImpinj is seeking a full-stack SaaS and IoT Software Engineering Intern to join our Enterprise Solutions team. We're building the next-generation platform that makes RAIN RFID technology accessible to businesses of all sizes, from healthcare to logistics to retail. Our work spans cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, real-time data processing, IoT device management, and developer tools.\n\nToday, customers who want to run custom code on Impinj readers must cross-compile ARM binaries, manage complex deployment pipelines, and navigate low-level system interfaces. It is powerful but requires expertise on multiple fronts and significant developer investment. Your mission: make it radically easier.\n\nYou will design and build an edge compute package that integrates with our cloud-based fleet management platform. Instead of wrestling with ELF binaries and cross-compilation toolchains, customers will write code in a high-level language, use an intuitive API to access reader functions, and deploy with a click. You'll lead this end-to-end, from runtime design to cloud integration, and deliver a working proof-of-concept by the end of summer.\n\nThis is a lighthouse project. If it works, it changes how we think about customer development experience and could shape our product roadmap.\nWhat You Will Do:\n• Design and implement an edge compute runtime that lets customers write reader applications in a high-level language\n• Build the supporting cloud infrastructure: bundle build/CI/CD, deployment, versioning, and rollback\n• Create an intuitive API that exposes reader functions to the runtime, with clear documentation\n• Integrate with our fleet management platform for configuration, deployment, and state reporting\n• Build UI components for code management in the admin console\n• Work directly with Product Management and the SVP of Engineering to translate product vision into technical implementation\n• Characterize and optimize performance: CPU, binary size, network usage, and memory footprint\n• Deliver a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates a radically simpler developer experience\nWhat You Will Bring:\n• Currently enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's program in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or similar program\n• We care less about credentials and more about what you've built. Show us impressive coursework, side projects, open-source contributions, or anything else that proves you can write good software and solve hard problems. Experience with low level languages like C/C++/Rust in resource constrained environments.\n• You take initiative, work independently, and find ways to overcome obstacles. Showcase your side projects or open-source contributions\n• You're genuinely excited about building things; you ask good questions, dig into how things work, and bring enthusiasm to the team.\n• Solid grasp of computer science basics, but also software development best practices. You thrive in close collaboration, communicate clearly, and know how to get stuff done on a team\n• This project has design, product, and business strategy dimensions. We want someone who's interested in those considerations and can integrate them into technical decisions\nWhy Intern with Impinj:\n\nThe Impinj Summer Internship Program is designed to provide undergraduate and graduate students with a comprehensive learning experience that goes beyond traditional work assignments. It offers a unique blend of professional development, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help interns thrive in their roles and prepare for successful careers. Students develop valuable skills through interactive learning sessions and receive personalized mentorship and guidance from early-career colleagues.\n\nThe program offers more than just a resume boost. It's a chance to access hands-on experience, leadership insights, and a network of peers and mentors that lasts well beyond the summer.\n\nLearn what our interns last year had to say about their experience: Impinj Intern Program: A Season of Learning, Connection, and Fun (Impinj blog).\n\nThis Summer Internship Cohort begins on Monday, June 15 and ends September 4. The start date is firm; the end date is flexible to end early. All internship positions report at least on a hybrid basis to our Seattle office. There is opportunity for full time employment for those graduates or those entering their senior year.\n\nCompensation & Benefits:\n\nThe benefits listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with Impinj and the country where you work.\n\nThe typical base pay range for this role across the US is $26.00/hr - $40.00/hr. Individual base pay depends on various factors such as complexity and responsibility of role, job duties, requirements, and relevant experience and skills. Both market wage data and the mid-point of the pay range is reviewed and used as the starting point for all new hire offers. Offers are made within the base pay range applicable at the time.\n\nAt Impinj certain roles are eligible for additional rewards, including merit increases, annual bonus and stock. These awards are allocated based on individual performance. In addition, certain roles also have the opportunity to earn sales incentives based on revenue or utilization, depending on the terms of the plan and the employee's role.

With a culture that’s all in on impact, innovation, and collaboration, Snowflake is the sweet spot for building big, moving fast, and taking technology — and careers — to the next level.\n\nThe Snowflake Openflow team is building Snowflake’s next-generation open, extensible, and secure data integration platform for real-time, scalable, bi-directional data movement, powered by Apache NiFi. We enable customers to move structured and multi-modal unstructured data across any source and any sink—Snowflake and non-Snowflake alike—through a single, cloud-native platform that supports batch and streaming, and flexible runtimes spanning Snowflake-managed (SPCS) and Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) data planes.\n\nOur team includes original creators and core contributors to Apache NiFi and industry leaders in data integration, now focused on bringing NiFi’s proven strengths—visual flows, rich connectors, and powerful routing—to Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud at enterprise scale. We work end to end across high-performance runtimes, and curated connectors, partnering closely with product, field, and open-source communities to help customers continuously ingest data, power AI and analytics workloads, and make smarter decisions in real time.\n\nAS A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER ON THE SNOWFLAKE OPENFLOW TEAM, YOU WILL:\n• Design and implement features in Openflow’s control plane and data plane, contributing to reliable, scalable, and secure services that power real-time, bi-directional data movement for our customers.\n• Build and evolve distributed systems for batch and streaming workloads, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data pipelines across Snowflake and non-Snowflake environments, for both structured and multi-modal unstructured data.\n• Own medium-sized projects end to end—from requirements clarification and technical design through implementation, testing, rollout, and follow-up improvements—with appropriate guidance from Staff and Principal engineers.\n• Take operational ownership of the components you build, including monitoring, on-call participation, incident response, and contributing to post-incident reviews and reliability improvements.\n• Apply and promote solid engineering practices in your area—clean code, robust testing, observability, security, and documentation—to keep our platform easy to operate and evolve.\n• Collaborate closely with peers across engineering, product, and design, translating ambiguous requirements into clear technical plans, breaking work into milestones, and communicating progress and risks.\n• Analyze and improve performance, scalability, and reliability of existing services and pipelines, using metrics, profiling, and experimentation to guide optimizations.\n• Mentor junior engineers and interns, providing constructive code reviews, design feedback, and sharing domain knowledge in Openflow, Snowflake, and distributed systems.\n• Contribute to shared platform tooling and patterns, helping make it easier for Openflow teams to build, deploy, and operate high-quality connectors and runtimes.\n\nOUR IDEAL SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER WILL HAVE:\n• 7+ years of industry experience building and operating backend or platform services, including significant hands-on work with distributed systems.\n• Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms, data structures, and systems design, with the ability to apply them pragmatically in production code.\n• Practical experience with distributed systems concepts, such as concurrency, replication, partitioning, streaming, and fault tolerance, and how they impact correctness, performance, and operability.\n• Solid understanding of operating systems and networking basics, including multi-threading, memory management, storage, and debugging performance/scale issues.\n• Proficiency in Java or a similar object-oriented language (e.g., Scala, Go, C++), and experience working in large, shared codebases.\n• Experience building cloud-native services on at least one major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP), using containers, CI/CD, and modern monitoring/logging stacks.\n• A track record of delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions to non-trivial engineering problems, balancing speed with long-term reliability and simplicity.\n• Strong collaboration and communication skills, with the ability to work effectively with teammates across locations, give and receive feedback, and explain technical trade-offs clearly.\n• BS in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent practical experience building and shipping distributed systems.\n• (Bonus) Experience with data integration, observability, or streaming/flow technologies (e.g., Apache NiFi, Kafka, Flink, Airflow, or similar) or with analytics/data platforms.\n\nEvery Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company’s confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data. Snowflake employees must abide by the company’s data security plan as an essential part of their duties. It is every employee's duty to keep customer information secure and confidential.\n\nSnowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.\n\nHow do you want to make your impact?\n\nFor jobs located in the United States, please visit the job posting on the Snowflake Careers Site for salary and benefits information: careers.snowflake.com\n\nThe following represents the expected range of compensation for this role:\n• The estimated base salary range for this role is $200,000 - $287,500.\n• Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Snowflake’s bonus and equity plan.\n\nThe successful candidate’s starting salary will be determined based on permissible, non-discriminatory factors such as skills, experience, and geographic location.
