    "job_description": "GiveCampus is the world's leading fundraising platform for non-profit educational institutions. Trusted by 1,300+ colleges, universities, and K-12 schools, our mission is to help advance the quality, the affordability, and the accessibility of education. We received a seed investment from Y Combinator in 2015 and have pursued a strategy of 'Sustainable Growth' ever since: achieving six consecutive years of profitability and positive cash-flow while more than quadrupling our revenue, our customer base, and our team. In 2022, we raised $50 million to accelerate the next stage of our growth.\n\nThrough The GiveCampus Social Mobility Initiative, we've donated $1 million in free fundraising support for programs that help low-income students, first-generation students, and underrepresented minorities. And in 2022 and 2023, we were named to Y Combinator's Top Companies list and the Inc. 5000 list of America's fastest-growing private companies.\n\nWhile we operate at meaningful scale (we've facilitated more than $6 billion in charitable giving), we're still small relative to the commercial and social good opportunities in front of us. Every GiveCampus employee has a substantial impact on our trajectory, and we're growing to help schools achieve even greater results.\n\nOur purpose-driven team of 120+ is located across the US: team members work from anywhere they choose. We have a beautiful 12,000 sf office in Washington, DC that is available for people to use whenever they want, and we regularly organize team meet-ups, events, and retreats in various locations. We're looking to expand our team with diverse and collaborative doers who believe in our mission and the transformative power of affordable, high-quality education.\n\nLocation: This is a remote-first role based in the U.S. While we embrace flexible, distributed work, we also value in-person connection. Team members are expected to attend multiple company-wide and team-specific onsites throughout the year.\n\nWe are hiring a Senior Software Engineer, Finance & Business Systems who is excited to work deeply embedded in the business — not siloed in a traditional engineering-only org. As GiveCampus scales, we need a deeper understanding of the true cost to serve our customers — across product usage, infrastructure, payments, support, and internal operations and fixing the system to reduce friction for our customers. This role exists to sit at the intersection of Finance, Engineering, and Operations, building the systems and instrumentation that make our unit economics visible, trustworthy, and actionable.\n\nThis role is ideal for a Rails engineer who wants to apply strong technical skills in close partnership with Finance, Operations, and Engineering leadership, and who is motivated by solving real operational problems rather than working exclusively from a product roadmap. This is not a traditional product engineering role. It is a deeply business-embedded engineering role with real leverage on how the company operates and scales.\n\nResponsibilities will include:\n• Working on the full stack, from UI elements to backend services including getting into database tuning and performance.\n• Iterating quickly, building new features from start to finish and back end to front end, including architecture design, coding, automated testing, and supporting each implementation in production.\n• Being adaptable - working closely with and supporting your teammates in a fast-paced, agile development environment (both within your pod and across Engineering as a whole).\n• Tackling a wide variety of technical issues throughout our stack and contributing to all parts of the code base and shared documentation.\n• Contributing to team-wide initiatives including coding standards, tech debt refinement and system security monitoring.\n• Participating in the interviewing and onboarding new team members and assisting in the refinement of our interviewing processes.\n• Participating in the support of the platform on a rotational basis (team-based support and paired, on-call rotation).\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n• Strong experience with Ruby on Rails or another mature MVC framework (e.g., Django). System design experience with a focus on architecting solutions that can be implemented incrementally while keeping an eye towards scale and resilience.\n• Comfort working across the stack, including backend services, databases, and light frontend work.\n• Experience with modern front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js.\n• SQL database experience (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).\n• Experience with deployments to Heroku, AWS, or similar.\n• Experience balancing swift and long-term code maintainability.\n• 5 plus years of hands-on development experience.\n• Comfort working with financial concepts such as margins, COGS, pricing, revenue recognition, or unit economics (direct experience or strong interest).\n• Experience building systems where correctness, auditability, and explainability matter.\n• Ability to work with non-technical stakeholders and translate ambiguous business questions into concrete technical work.\n• Ability to handle ambiguity and shaping the problem, not just the solution.\n\nBonus points if you have:\n• Deep expertise with Ruby/Ruby on Rails and RSpec.\n• Experience with Postgres database administration.\n• Shipped code that has supported tens of thousands of users, including enterprise/business customers.\n• Operations experience and how it pertains to site reliability/speed.\n• Familiarity with networking, caching, database, and how to triage performance and stability issues.\n• Experience working on a fundraising/crowdfunding platform.\n• Experience working on a fintech or payments technology product.\n• Experience working in a start up environment\n• A good eye for intuitive, user-friendly front end design.\n• Experience building internal tools or platforms used by Finance or Operations teams\nReady to apply?\n\nBe sure to keep an eye on your spam and promotions boxes in case our emails end up there!\n\nAt GiveCampus, we value diversity and we pledge to foster an environment of support, inclusivity, and learning, both on the job and throughout the application process. In this spirit, we encourage candidates of all backgrounds to apply.\n\nGiveCampus is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Applicants and employees are not discriminated against because of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion, national origin, citizenship status, disability, ancestry, marital status, veteran status, medical condition or any protected category prohibited by local, state or federal laws.\n\nIf you feel like you don't meet all of the requirements for this role, please apply anyways. We know confidence gaps and imposter syndrome often get in the way of connecting with incredible people, and we don't want them to prevent us from meeting you.",

    "job_description": "Snowflake is about empowering enterprises to achieve their full potential — and people too. With a culture that’s all in on impact, innovation, and collaboration, Snowflake is the sweet spot for building big, moving fast, and taking technology — and careers — to the next level.\n\nThe Snowflake Openflow team is building Snowflake’s next-generation open, extensible, and secure data integration platform for real-time, scalable, bi-directional data movement, powered by Apache NiFi. We enable customers to move structured and multi-modal unstructured data across any source and any sink—Snowflake and non-Snowflake alike—through a single, cloud-native platform that supports batch and streaming, and flexible runtimes spanning Snowflake-managed (SPCS) and Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) data planes.\n\nOur team includes original creators and core contributors to Apache NiFi and industry leaders in data integration, now focused on bringing NiFi’s proven strengths—visual flows, rich connectors, and powerful routing—to Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud at enterprise scale. We work end to end across high-performance runtimes, and curated connectors, partnering closely with product, field, and open-source communities to help customers continuously ingest data, power AI and analytics workloads, and make smarter decisions in real time.\n\nAS A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER ON THE SNOWFLAKE OPENFLOW TEAM, YOU WILL:\n• Design and implement features in Openflow’s control plane and data plane, contributing to reliable, scalable, and secure services that power real-time, bi-directional data movement for our customers.\n• Build and evolve distributed systems for batch and streaming workloads, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data pipelines across Snowflake and non-Snowflake environments, for both structured and multi-modal unstructured data.\n• Own medium-sized projects end to end—from requirements clarification and technical design through implementation, testing, rollout, and follow-up improvements—with appropriate guidance from Staff and Principal engineers.\n• Take operational ownership of the components you build, including monitoring, on-call participation, incident response, and contributing to post-incident reviews and reliability improvements.\n• Apply and promote solid engineering practices in your area—clean code, robust testing, observability, security, and documentation—to keep our platform easy to operate and evolve.\n• Collaborate closely with peers across engineering, product, and design, translating ambiguous requirements into clear technical plans, breaking work into milestones, and communicating progress and risks.\n• Analyze and improve performance, scalability, and reliability of existing services and pipelines, using metrics, profiling, and experimentation to guide optimizations.\n• Mentor junior engineers and interns, providing constructive code reviews, design feedback, and sharing domain knowledge in Openflow, Snowflake, and distributed systems.\n• Contribute to shared platform tooling and patterns, helping make it easier for Openflow teams to build, deploy, and operate high-quality connectors and runtimes.\n\nOUR IDEAL SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER WILL HAVE:\n• 7+ years of industry experience building and operating backend or platform services, including significant hands-on work with distributed systems.\n• Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms, data structures, and systems design, with the ability to apply them pragmatically in production code.\n• Practical experience with distributed systems concepts, such as concurrency, replication, partitioning, streaming, and fault tolerance, and how they impact correctness, performance, and operability.\n• Solid understanding of operating systems and networking basics, including multi-threading, memory management, storage, and debugging performance/scale issues.\n• Proficiency in Java or a similar object-oriented language (e.g., Scala, Go, C++), and experience working in large, shared codebases.\n• Experience building cloud-native services on at least one major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP), using containers, CI/CD, and modern monitoring/logging stacks.\n• A track record of delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions to non-trivial engineering problems, balancing speed with long-term reliability and simplicity.\n• Strong collaboration and communication skills, with the ability to work effectively with teammates across locations, give and receive feedback, and explain technical trade-offs clearly.\n• BS in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent practical experience building and shipping distributed systems.\n• (Bonus) Experience with data integration, observability, or streaming/flow technologies (e.g., Apache NiFi, Kafka, Flink, Airflow, or similar) or with analytics/data platforms.\n\nEvery Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company’s confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data. Snowflake employees must abide by the company’s data security plan as an essential part of their duties. It is every employee's duty to keep customer information secure and confidential.\n\nSnowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.\n\nHow do you want to make your impact?\n\nFor jobs located in the United States, please visit the job posting on the Snowflake Careers Site for salary and benefits information: careers.snowflake.com\n\nThe following represents the expected range of compensation for this role:\n• The estimated base salary range for this role is $200,000 - $287,500.\n• Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Snowflake’s bonus and equity plan.\n\nThe successful candidate’s starting salary will be determined based on permissible, non-discriminatory factors such as skills, experience, and geographic location. This role is also eligible for a competitive benefits package that includes: medical, dental, vision, life, and disability insurance; 401(k) retirement plan; flexible spending & health savings account; at least 12 paid holidays; paid time off; parental leave; employee assistance program; and other company benefits.\n\nTo comply with pay transparency requirements and other statutes, you can notify us if you believe that a job posting is not compliant by completing this form.",
