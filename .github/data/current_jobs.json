You have a deep understanding of design system philosophy and systematic approaches. You know what works, what doesn't, and why. You care about the craft of UI engineering, the difference between something that works and something that feels polished.\n\nYou'll combine deep technical expertise with a passion for enabling others through well-crafted tools and systems. You'll build components that other engineers love using, establish patterns that scale across our codebase, and drive technical direction in UI architecture. You'll collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure our components don't just work; they feel right. And you'll build relationships and help drive adoption through tools, documentation, and collaboration.\nRemote Work Qualifications\n• Access to a reliable and secure high-speed internet connection.

We value relevant skills and experience and alignment with our core values above all else.\nDesired Traits & Skills\n• Active engagement with design system community and industry best practices.\n• Familiarity with Tailwind CSS (used in surrounding codebase).\n• Experience with React Native or cross-platform design systems.\n• Contributions to open-source design systems or component libraries.\n• Experience building internal tooling for design-to-code workflows.\n• Knowledge of animation and micro-interaction implementation.\n\nOne Part of the Bigger Picture\n\nWebstaurantStore’s parent company, Clark Associates, has made the Central Penn Business Journal’s list of “Top 50 Fastest Growing Companies” in Pennsylvania for 9 years in a row. The base of Clark’s success comes from four key directives: Hiring great people, creating value for customers, and investing in employees and their communities. These pillars drive each of Clark Associates’ multi-million-dollar businesses forward, including WebstaurantStore and other industry-leading names like 11400, Clark Food Service Equipment, The Restaurant Store, and Clark National Accounts.\n\nAre You Ready?\n\nEntrepreneurial Spirit is the driving force behind WebstaurantStore’s work environment. Making things better for our customers is our goal every single day. Achieving that goal means taking risks, accepting failure, and learning from our mistakes. If that sounds like a mission you’re ready to be a part of, we’d love to discuss this role with you further, and we’re excited to meet you!\n\nNever heard of us? That’s okay! We love sharing our stories.\n• WebstaurantStore | About Us\n• Video Message from Leadership\n• Clark Associates Timeline [Parent Company]\n\nCheck us out on:\n• LinkedIn\n• Instagram\n• Facebook\n• YouTube\n• TikTok\n• Pinterest\n• X/Twitter",
