With a culture that’s all in on impact, innovation, and collaboration, Snowflake is the sweet spot for building big, moving fast, and taking technology — and careers — to the next level.\n\nSnowflake started with a clear vision: develop a cloud data platform that is effective, affordable, and accessible to all data users. Snowflake developed an innovative new product with a built-for-the-cloud architecture that combines the power of data warehousing, the flexibility of big data platforms, and the elasticity of the cloud at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions. We are now a global, world-class organization with offices in more than a dozen countries and serving many more.\n\nThe Apps & Experiences (AppEx) organization powers the unified user experience for Snowflake. Every major Snowflake customer interacts with our platform through these surfaces, making AppEx central to both customer satisfaction and revenue growth.\n\nWithin Appex, our team sits at the intersection of AI, platform, and user experience. We are on a mission to create an AI‑first, scalable, maintainable, and extensible platform to build all Snowflake user experience features. The team owns:\n• The entire serving layer that powers Snowsight, Snowflake Intelligence, and UX features\n• Frontend infrastructure and shared services for product teams\n• Storage and metadata systems backing UX features and AI workflows\n• Testing and reliability systems, including CI/CD pipelines and release tooling\n\nThe monitoring and logging stack that ensures observability and trust\n\nAS A BACKEND SOFTWARE ENGINEER ON THIS TEAM, YOU WILL:\n• Build AI-first platform services that power Snowflake’s user experiences, including APIs, orchestration services, and storage layers that are safe, scalable, and easy to extend.\n• Design and implement agentic systems and tools that automate complex coding, migration, and testing workflows (e.g., SQL/ETL migration, refactoring, and validation for customers adopting Snowflake).\n• Own the full backend lifecycle: design, implementation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement of production services.\n• Scale automated coding agents and backend workflows to dramatically reduce human effort.\n• Define and improve evaluation loops: build golden datasets, rubrics, and metrics to measure quality of AI- and agent-driven systems, then “hillclimb” on those metrics.\n• Evolve the serving & infra layer for Snowsight and related experiences (routing, configuration, permissions, performance tuning, resiliency).\n• Improve platform reliability by investing in observability, alerting, SLOs, and automated remediation across our serving, storage, and AI systems.\n• Collaborate cross-functionally with forward deployed engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, and other PE and Cortex teams to turn real-world customer problems into robust, shipped product features.\n• Contribute to technical vision for an AI-first user experience platform and help set best practices for backend and AI engineering within the org.\n\nOUR IDEAL SOFTWARE ENGINEER WILL HAVE:\n• 3+ years of industry experience designing and building backend systems or large-scale web applications.\n• Strong programming skills in at least one of: Java, Go, Python\n• Solid experience building and operating distributed systems and microservices:\n• REST/gRPC APIs, service-to-service communication, configuration management\n• Performance tuning, caching, and scalability patterns\n• Strong SQL skills and experience with relational databases; experience with Snowflake, SQL Server, Oracle, or Teradata is a plus.\n• Deep computer science fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design.\n• Experience with or strong interest in:\n• AI/ML or LLM-based applications (agents, prompt/tool engineering, evals, or productionized AI features)\n• Building evaluation frameworks, metrics, and “golden sets” for AI or automation systems\n• Familiarity with modern web application architectures, including:\n• Backend-for-frontend patterns, API gateways, authentication/authorization, and secure service design\n• Optional: exposure to TypeScript/Node.js or React is a plus, especially when collaborating closely with frontend teams.\n• Experience building highly reliable, observable systems:\n• Logging, tracing, metrics, dashboards, and on-call best practices\n• Testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, end-to-end, load/regression)\n• Passion for AI-first user experiences and for building platforms that enable many teams to move faster while keeping systems maintainable and safe.\n• Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work across disciplines and drive cross-functional initiatives.\n• BS/MS in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience.\n\nEvery Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company’s confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data. Snowflake employees must abide by the company’s data security plan as an essential part of their duties. It is every employee's duty to keep customer information secure and confidential.\n\nSnowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.\n\nHow do you want to make your impact?\n\nFor jobs located in the United States, please visit the job posting on the Snowflake Careers Site for salary and benefits information: careers.snowflake.com\n\nThe following represents the expected range of compensation for this role:\n• The estimated base salary range for this role is $160,000 - $230,000.\n• Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Snowflake’s bonus and equity plan.\n\nThe successful candidate’s starting salary will be determined based on permissible, non-discriminatory factors such as skills, experience, and geographic location.

It allows our customers to leverage the best open source observability software - including Prometheus, Mimir, Loki, Tempo, and Pyroscope - without the overhead of installing, maintaining and scaling their own observability stack.\n\nThe Databases team owns and operates the telemetry databases that are Mimir for metrics, Loki for logs, Tempo for traces, and Pyroscope for profiles. Our databases are offered as a hosted service in Grafana Cloud, and additionally as on-premise solutions with Grafana Enterprise Metrics, Grafana Enterprise Logs, and Grafana Enterprise Traces. They are multi-tenant distributed systems implemented in Go and operating at scale on Kubernetes across all major Cloud service providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).\n\nAs a company we are remote-first and global, we embrace people of different experiences and backgrounds to build diverse teams where every person brings a new perspective to the software.\n\nThe Opportunity:\n\nThe Mimir squad has 3 sub-squads, Ingest, Storage, and Query, which together maintain the Mimir OSS project, and additionally own and operate Grafana Cloud Metrics across 3 major cloud providers. Engineers on the team focus on optimizing the efficiency and resilience of processing, storing, and querying metrics at large volumes. These services operate at a large scale and performance is key to keeping the offering competitive and running smoothly.\n\nA Mimir engineer has various work streams. They are likely engaged in a larger project with another engineer, and they are also incorporating some performance and reliability improvements discovered through operating the system in production.

You can use modern AI coding assistants as part of your daily workflow (your choice of tools, within security guidelines), backed by a company-funded usage budget so you can iterate quickly without unnecessary friction.\n\nWe encourage pragmatic AI-assisted development: faster prototyping, test generation, refactors, documentation, and incident follow-ups-always paired with strong code review and quality standards.\n\nYou'll also have access to frontier models (e.g., GPT-Codex 5/3, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro).\n\nWhat Makes You a Great Fit:\n\nYou are a motivated self-starter with a bias towards action.
