We are committed to providing interns with a meaningful learning experience where they can grow, connect with other emerging professionals passionate about our mission, and learn. Internship Opportunity VisionFund International (VFI), the microfinance arm of World Vision, provides essential financial services, including credit, insurance, and savings, to underserved communities globally. The Global Internal Audit (GIA) department plays a crucial role in delivering independent audit and assurance services to VFI. VFI GIA's key strategic priority for FY26 is to leverage technology to create a more efficient and effective audit methodology. This includes a multi-country roll-out of an app developed in-house for digitizing Internal Audit client questionnaires. We are seeking a React Native Developer to redesign and enhance an existing Android mobile application that imports, displays, and updates XLS files with user responses. The role involves implementing internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages (Spanish, English, French), refactoring the app to be flexible and configuration-driven, and improving XLS handling and mobile UI/UX. The intern will be responsible for reviewing the current codebase, designing a scalable architecture, and delivering a maintainable solution with clear documentation and testing. This position requires strong expertise in React Native, i18n frameworks, and XLS integration, with the ability to translate business requirements into a robust, user-friendly mobile application. What You'll Do: Redesign existing React Native app to support bilingual/multilingual UI (Spanish, English, French). Implement internationalization (i18n) using libraries like react-i18next. Refactor the app to be parametric and flexible, allowing configuration-driven questions and XLS mappings. Enhance XLS file handling (import/export) with robust validation and formatting. Improve UI/UX for dynamic forms and responsive design. Write clean, maintainable, secure, and well-documented code. Implement unit tests for XLS logic and language switching. Collaborate with stakeholders to gather requirements and propose technical solutions. Design a road map and training materials to implement in microfinance institutions (MFIs) operating across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe with different IT ecosystems. Why Join Us Global Team Collaboration: Join a diverse global audit team comprising professionals from various cultural backgrounds with expertise in microfinance, data analytics, audit and assurance, finance, accounting, and fraud. The intern will also collaborate with IT departments at the Global Centre and across our MFIs. Benefit from their enthusiasm for coaching and mentoring. Skill Development: Gain hands-on experience managing a real, multi-country technology rollout in an international organisation. Develop practical technical, project management, stakeholder engagement, and communication skills. Expand Your Horizons: Explore the international relief sector, unleash your leadership skills, and strengthen your Christian faith with Weekly Professional Development Sessions. Transform Lives: Take on challenging and meaningful work assignments while developing your technical skills and gaining valuable hands-on experience. Join an Inspiring Community: Form connections with a diverse nationwide intern cohort and colleagues who, inspired by their Christian faith, support children of all backgrounds, even in the most dangerous places. What You’ll Bring: Experience with React Native, React.js, and modern frontend for Android development. React Native components (e.g., FlatList, ScrollView, TouchableOpacity, react-native-fs, react-native-document-picker) Native modules integration (for file system access, XLS import/export on Android) Android build tools (Gradle, Android Studio) Testing frameworks for mobile (Detox, Appium, or React Native Testing Library), Familiarity with internationalization libraries (react-i18next, react-intl).

Meticulous attention to detail and high work accuracy standards. An independent and virtual team player who can work autonomously and thrive in a virtual team environment, across different time zones.
