We build products that enable the creation of high-quality subtitling, dubbing, and accessibility assets, empowering linguists through advanced AI/ML-driven creative tools. We develop platforms that manage and streamline logistics across the entire localization lifecycle, allowing partners to focus on strategic and creative decision-making. Together, we ensure Netflix feels immersive, authentic, and meaningful for members in every language.\n\nQualifications\n• You have experience crafting resilient, high-scale, low-latency microservices in production environments.\n• Proficient with gRPC, GraphQL, or RESTful API design and implementation using OO programming languages like Java, C#.\n• Are adept at building enterprise applications with HTML/JavaScript/TypeScript/CSS. We currently build our user experiences with React, GraphQL, and several more libraries and frameworks depending on the product.\n• Work cross-functionally to build, test, deploy, and launch UIs that operationalize our workflows at scale\n• You have a proven track record of resilient data modeling through understanding and translating business requirements to technical requirements and identifying entities and their relationships that will serve the business process needs.\n• You participate in our on-call rotation and lead the incident reviews.\n\nWhat Sets You Apart\n• You are a resourceful full-stack engineer who can independently identify the root cause of issues and implement dependable, maintainable solutions across the entire stack.\n• Maintain strong relationships with cross-functional teams through clear communication.\n• Take a thoughtful, practical approach to problem-solving that considers tradeoffs and avoids over-engineering.\n• Seek different perspectives, feedback, and relevant information to continuously grow and improve.\n• Comfortable asking questions and seeking knowledge in unfamiliar or ambiguous situations.\n• You evangelize new ideas and exemplify technical leadership with a bias for action.\n• You appreciate the complexity of engaging with a global challenge\n\nA few more things about us:\n\nAs a team, we come from many different countries and our fields of education range from the humanities to engineering to computer science.

    "job_description": "Warning: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.\n\nWanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.\n\nOur founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.\n\nWe now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.\n\nWe also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nAs an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:\n• Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)\n• Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!\n• Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.\n• Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.\n• Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.\n• Review code written by other engineers.\n• Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.\n\nThis position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.\n\nWhat you might work on:\n• New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.\n• AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.\n• Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.\n• A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.\n• Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.\n• A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.\n\nYou may be a good fit if you:\n• Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.\n• Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them.\n• Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.\n• Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.\n• Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.\n\nWhat’s it like to work here?\n\nWe’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.\n\nOur values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.\n\nWe believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.\n\nOur hiring process\n\nWe’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual onsite via video call.\n\nFounders\n\nPeter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.\n\nHarry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.\n\nBefore building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!",
