Opportunity may also be remote.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The fellow will be a part of development of a widely-used online wildland fire smoke modeling system that relies on the BlueSky Modeling Framework. The BlueSky Playground provides users with interactive access to fire, fuels, emissions, plume rise, and smoke dispersion modeling capabilities. It enables users to enter basic fire information and explore modeled outcomes across a variety of scenarios, supporting applications including prescribed burn planning, wildfire operations, research, and public communication. The fellow will be a part of the ground-up rewrite of the BlueSky Playground with the goal of developing a scalable, modern, and performant system that meets the needs of an active and diverse user base. This system is used operationally today across federal, state, and academic contexts, and the redevelopment effort will directly support real-world decision making. The fellow will have the opportunity to be a contributor, while interacting closely with a team of senior software engineers and Forest Service scientists. Mentorship will be provided through regular technical discussions, informal guidance, and collaborative problem-solving, with some independent research.\n\nThe fellow’s research may include, but is not limited to:\n• Designing and implementing a modern software architecture for an interactive scientific modeling application\n• Developing and modernizing user interface components using contemporary JavaScript frameworks, while integrating with an existing backend API that will remain largely unchanged.\n• Collaborating with scientific and operational stakeholders to translate requirements into robust technical solutions\n• The resulting system is expected to support a range of users, including wildfire managers, air quality professionals, researchers, and the public.\n\nLearning Objectives\n• Gain experience writing maintainable, modern software in a scientific and operational research environment\n• Gain knowledge about how to design software systems that balance usability, operational reliability, and scientific rigor\n• Have the opportunity to experience the full software lifecycle, from architecture and development through documentation and maintenance\n• Develop skills in a collaborative environment with interdisciplinary stakeholders, such as scientists, software engineers, and operational users\n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Susan O'Neill (susan.oneill1@usda.gov) and Sim Larkin (sim.larkin@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: Spring/Summer 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The expectation is full time but can be part time initially.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

    "job_description": "Impinj is a leading RAIN RFID provider and Internet of Things pioneer. We're inventing ways to connect every thing to the Internet — including retail apparel, retail general merchandise, healthcare items, automobile parts, airline baggage, food and much more. With more than 100 billion items connected to date, and multiple Fortune 500 enterprises around the world using our platform, we solve for a better understanding of our world. If it's a thing, we're working to connect it. Join Impinj and help us realize our vision of a boundless IoT— connecting trillions of everyday items to the Internet.\n\nTeam Overview:\n\nImpinj is seeking a full-stack SaaS and IoT Software Engineering Intern to join our Enterprise Solutions team. We're building the next-generation platform that makes RAIN RFID technology accessible to businesses of all sizes, from healthcare to logistics to retail. Our work spans cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, real-time data processing, IoT device management, and developer tools.\n\nToday, customers who want to run custom code on Impinj readers must cross-compile ARM binaries, manage complex deployment pipelines, and navigate low-level system interfaces. It is powerful but requires expertise on multiple fronts and significant developer investment. Your mission: make it radically easier.\n\nYou will design and build an edge compute package that integrates with our cloud-based fleet management platform. Instead of wrestling with ELF binaries and cross-compilation toolchains, customers will write code in a high-level language, use an intuitive API to access reader functions, and deploy with a click. You'll lead this end-to-end, from runtime design to cloud integration, and deliver a working proof-of-concept by the end of summer.\n\nThis is a lighthouse project. If it works, it changes how we think about customer development experience and could shape our product roadmap.\nWhat You Will Do:\n• Design and implement an edge compute runtime that lets customers write reader applications in a high-level language\n• Build the supporting cloud infrastructure: bundle build/CI/CD, deployment, versioning, and rollback\n• Create an intuitive API that exposes reader functions to the runtime, with clear documentation\n• Integrate with our fleet management platform for configuration, deployment, and state reporting\n• Build UI components for code management in the admin console\n• Work directly with Product Management and the SVP of Engineering to translate product vision into technical implementation\n• Characterize and optimize performance: CPU, binary size, network usage, and memory footprint\n• Deliver a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates a radically simpler developer experience\nWhat You Will Bring:\n• Currently enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's program in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or similar program\n• We care less about credentials and more about what you've built. Show us impressive coursework, side projects, open-source contributions, or anything else that proves you can write good software and solve hard problems. Experience with low level languages like C/C++/Rust in resource constrained environments.\n• You take initiative, work independently, and find ways to overcome obstacles. Showcase your side projects or open-source contributions\n• You're genuinely excited about building things; you ask good questions, dig into how things work, and bring enthusiasm to the team.\n• Solid grasp of computer science basics, but also software development best practices. You thrive in close collaboration, communicate clearly, and know how to get stuff done on a team\n• This project has design, product, and business strategy dimensions. We want someone who's interested in those considerations and can integrate them into technical decisions\nWhy Intern with Impinj:\n\nThe Impinj Summer Internship Program is designed to provide undergraduate and graduate students with a comprehensive learning experience that goes beyond traditional work assignments. It offers a unique blend of professional development, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help interns thrive in their roles and prepare for successful careers. Students develop valuable skills through interactive learning sessions and receive personalized mentorship and guidance from early-career colleagues.\n\nThe program offers more than just a resume boost. It's a chance to access hands-on experience, leadership insights, and a network of peers and mentors that lasts well beyond the summer.\n\nLearn what our interns last year had to say about their experience: Impinj Intern Program: A Season of Learning, Connection, and Fun (Impinj blog).\n\nThis Summer Internship Cohort begins on Monday, June 15 and ends September 4. The start date is firm; the end date is flexible to end early. All internship positions report at least on a hybrid basis to our Seattle office. There is opportunity for full time employment for those graduates or those entering their senior year.\n\nCompensation & Benefits:\n\nThe benefits listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with Impinj and the country where you work.\n\nThe typical base pay range for this role across the US is $26.00/hr - $40.00/hr. Individual base pay depends on various factors such as complexity and responsibility of role, job duties, requirements, and relevant experience and skills. Both market wage data and the mid-point of the pay range is reviewed and used as the starting point for all new hire offers. Offers are made within the base pay range applicable at the time.\n\nAt Impinj certain roles are eligible for additional rewards, including merit increases, annual bonus and stock. These awards are allocated based on individual performance. In addition, certain roles also have the opportunity to earn sales incentives based on revenue or utilization, depending on the terms of the plan and the employee's role. US based employees have access to healthcare benefits; a 401(k) plan and company match among others.\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of US employment benefits, click here.\nUS Export Controls:\n\nThis position has access to technologies or data subject to U.S. export control regulations.
