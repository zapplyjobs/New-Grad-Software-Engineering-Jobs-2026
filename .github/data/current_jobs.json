    "job_description": "Warning: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.\n\nWanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.\n\nOur founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.\n\nWe now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.\n\nWe also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nAs an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:\n• Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)\n• Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!\n• Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.\n• Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.\n• Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.\n• Review code written by other engineers.\n• Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.\n\nThis position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.\n\nWhat you might work on:\n• New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.\n• AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.\n• Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.\n• A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.\n• Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.\n• A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.\n\nYou may be a good fit if you:\n• Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.\n• Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them.\n• Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.\n• Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.\n• Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.\n\nWhat’s it like to work here?\n\nWe’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.\n\nOur values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.\n\nWe believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.\n\nOur hiring process\n\nWe’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual onsite via video call.\n\nFounders\n\nPeter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.\n\nHarry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.\n\nBefore building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!",

Residents earn points for paying rent, attending events, and referring friends—redeemable for real perks at hundreds of brands. For operators, we drive retention, boost NOI, and turn residents into brand ambassadors.\n\nWe're an early, well-funded company at an inflection point, actively building our product, our systems, and our engineering practices. This is a year where individual engineers can have an outsized impact. We're not inheriting a finished playbook—we're writing it.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nThis role is focused on the financial products side of our platform—flexible payment solutions for residents and credit monitoring integrations. You'll be building and improving systems where reliability and data integrity aren't nice-to-haves, they're the whole point.\n• Build and ship features across our flexible payment and credit monitoring systems\n• Integrate with third-party financial services APIs and maintain those integrations as they evolve\n• Develop backend services that support financial workflows—payment processing, credit data pipelines, and rent reporting\n• Work across the stack, with a heavier emphasis on backend and data reliability\n• Collaborate closely with product and leadership to shape how financial products fit into the broader platform\n• Use AI coding assistants to accelerate development and learning\n• Help improve observability, error handling, and data consistency in systems where getting it wrong has real consequences\n\nOur Stack\n\nReactJS, NestJS, AWS AppSync, Lambda\n\nWe care more about fundamentals and the ability to learn fast (with AI as your copilot) than checking every box. Fintech experience matters more than matching our exact stack—if you've built reliable integrations with financial APIs before, you'll ramp quickly.\n\nAI-Assisted Development (Required)\n\nAI is part of our everyday workflow. We expect you to be comfortable:\n• Using tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, or similar\n• Using AI for problem decomposition, debugging, testing, and documentation\n• Evaluating, editing, and refactoring AI-generated code\n• Explaining why you accepted, modified, or rejected AI suggestions\n\nOver time, we expect engineers to help the team discover better ways to use AI—not just faster ones.\n\nWe're hiring engineers with judgment, not prompt engineers.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n• ~2–5 years of professional software development experience (or equivalent)\n• Some experience with fintech, payments, lending, credit systems, or financial data—you don't need to be a domain expert, but you shouldn't be starting from zero\n• Experience integrating with third-party APIs, especially where data accuracy and reliability matter\n• Comfort working across the stack, even if backend is your stronger side\n• Thoughtful about data modeling, error handling, and system reliability\n• Willingness to ask questions, take feedback, and grow quickly\n• Clear communication and a collaborative mindset\n\nBonus points:\n• Familiarity with payment processing, installment/flexible payment systems, or credit reporting\n• Exposure to compliance-aware environments (PCI familiarity helpful but not required)\n• Experience in proptech, property management, or multifamily\n\nWhat Success Looks Like (First 6 Months)\n• Ship meaningful improvements to our financial product integrations that reach production\n• Demonstrate growing comfort navigating financial data flows and third-party API contracts\n• Introduce or refine ways AI helps us build, test, debug, or reason about our systems\n• Take increasing ownership of features and technical decisions in the fintech domain\n• Contribute ideas that improve how we build, not just what we build\n\nThe expectation isn't that you arrive as a senior engineer—it's that you're clearly becoming one.\n\nBenefits\n• Health, dental, and vision insurance\n• Flexible PTO\n\nWhy Austin, Why Onsite\n\nWe're a small, tight-knit engineering team that works better in the same room. Whiteboards get used. Conversations happen in real time. When you're working on financial systems, being able to turn around and ask \"does this edge case matter?\" beats a Slack thread every time. If you're looking for a remote gig, this isn't it—but if you want to be in the room where decisions get made, keep reading.",

At Overstory, we're harnessing cutting-edge technology to enable a resilient electrical grid that keeps communities thriving as our world changes.\n\nThe grid is the backbone of life as we know it. It powers hospitals, keeps food fresh, and ensures communities stay connected. But extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and growing wildfire risks are putting this critical system under pressure. All of this combined makes the electric utility industry the greatest opportunity for tackling climate change.\n\nOne of the leading causes of catastrophic wildfires and power outages? Trees and brush coming into contact with power lines.\n\nThat's where we help. At Overstory, we use AI and advanced satellite imagery to pinpoint and prioritize vegetation risks before they materialize. By giving utilities critical analysis on those risks, we're helping prevent outages, reduce wildfire risks, and accelerate the transition to a safer, more resilient grid.\n\nOur team spans the Americas and Europe, and we work with utility partners across the Americas and beyond. We're outdoor enthusiasts, musicians, artists, athletes, parents, and adventurers-15 nationalities strong and growing.

We also offer the option to occasionally meet up for in-person collaboration.\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nWe place enormous value on diversity and inclusion and strive to continually bring in people of all genders, races, creeds, ethnicities, abilities and backgrounds. We believe that the best ideas emerge when people with different perspectives and approaches work together on a problem.\n\nWe're always looking to diversify our team further, but we're proud of the fact that four out of the nine people on our leadership team are female, 46% of the overall team are female and 20% of the team are people of color. Our team speaks fifteen languages: English, Dutch, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Luxembourgish, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, Cantonese, Estonian, Danish and Korean.\nOur values\nTackling the climate crisis is our greatest mission.\n\nWe act with urgency.\nOur curiosity fuels our growth.\n\nWe recognize that change is constant, and we find joy and power in exploration.\nWe're rooted in diversity.\n\nJust as ecosystems need biodiversity to thrive, our resiliency comes from our differences.\nWe care for each other.\n\nWe love the power of machines but we nurture each other as humans.\nTrust is fundamental.\n\nWe assume the best in everyone, and we share ideas openly so that we have a positive impact.\n\nUse of AI in Our Hiring Process\n\nWe sometimes use AI tools to support parts of our hiring process, such as helping us manage applications more efficiently or ensuring job descriptions are clear and inclusive.
