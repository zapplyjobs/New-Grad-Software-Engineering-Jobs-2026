Leveraging cutting-edge technology, we transform concepts into breathtaking, immersive experiences.\n\nRole Overview\n\nWe're looking for a Senior Full Stack Developer to help build and scale our digital twin platform-a system that blends CMS-driven content, real-time data, spatial assets, and high-performance frontends deployed both in the cloud and on-prem.\n\nThis is a hands-on, product-minded engineering role. You'll own features end to end-from schema and API design through frontend implementation and deployment-and help shape technical direction as the platform grows.\n\nYou should be comfortable operating in a modern but opinionated stack, working in a monorepo, and navigating real-world complexity (large assets, mixed deployment targets, real-time updates).\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nFront-End Development (Primary Focus)\n• Build and maintain complex, data-driven UIs using React and Next.js\n• Implement CMS-driven layouts and dynamic content blocks that scale across products and deployments\n• Collaborate with UX/UI designers to translate designs into fast, intuitive, accessible user experiences.\n• Optimize front-end performance for complex, data-heavy applications.\n• Ensure responsiveness and cross-browser behavior across kiosk, desktop, and tablet form factors\n\nBack-End & Full Stack Development\n• Design and extend APIs (REST and/or GraphQL) that support content, configuration, and real-time state\n• Collaborate on data modeling, system architecture, and integration patterns.\n• Support real-time data flows and integrations relevant to digital twin platforms.\n• Support integrations involving real-time messaging, device state, or spatial data\n• Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code with an eye toward long-term platform evolution\n• Work with Payload CMS (or similar headless CMS) on schema design, access control, and content modeling\n• Design or extend IAC (infrastructure as code) to build immutable infrastructure that can be deployed in AWS and on custom local deployments\n\nCollaboration & Technical Leadership\n• Work within an Nx-based monorepo, collaborating across frontend, backend, and shared libraries\n• Participate in architectural discussions around data flow, caching, environment separation, and deployments\n• Review code, mentor other engineers, and raise the bar on code quality and system design\n• Help improve developer tooling, workflows, and CI/CD processes over time\n\nQualifications\n• 5-8+ years of professional software development experience, including full stack roles.\n• Strong experience building front-end applications with React and modern frontend patterns.\n• Experience building applications with Next.js or similar meta-frameworks\n• Proficiency in TypeScript across frontend and backend\n• Proficiency with Docker, Kubernetes, or other containerized deployment strategies\n• Experience with CDK, Terraform, or other IAC libs\n• Proficiency with Postgres, SQL, Mongo or other modern db\n• Experience with back-end technologies such as Node.js, Python, Java, or similar.\n• Experience designing and consuming APIs (REST and/or GraphQL)\n• Comfort working across the stack-not just the UI or just the backend\n• Solid understanding of performance, scalability, and system design tradeoffs\n\nPreferred Experience\n• Experience with PayloadCMS or other Headless CMS Platforms\n• Familiarity with monorepos (Nx, Turborepo, etc.)\n• Experience with media-heavy, spatial, or 3D-adjacent applications\n• Exposure to real-time systems (WebSockets, MQTT, event-driven architectures)\n• Familiarity with cloud infrastructure and constrained/on-prem deployments (Docker, Linux, etc...)\n• Exposure to architecture, AEC, BIM, or spatial data workflows.\n• Experience working in agile development environments.\n• Opportunity to work on cutting-edge digital twin technology.\n• Collaborative, product-driven engineering culture.\n• Competitive compensation and benefits.\n• Flexible work environment with opportunities for growth.\n• Applicants must be legally authorized to work in the United States.\n• This position is based in Sarasota, FL.
