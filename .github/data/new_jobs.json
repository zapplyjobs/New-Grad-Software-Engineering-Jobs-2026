We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s Reinforcement Learning organization leads the research and development that trains Claude to be capable, reliable, and safe. We&#39;ve contributed to every Claude model, with significant impacts on the autonomy and coding capabilities of our most advanced models. Our work spans developing systems that enable models to use computers effectively, advancing code generation through reinforcement learning, pioneering fundamental RL research for large language models, and building scalable training methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RL org is organized around four key goals: solving the science of long-horizon tasks and continual learning, scaling RL data and environments to be comprehensive and diverse, automating software engineering end-to-end, and training the frontier production model. We collaborate closely with Anthropic&#39;s alignment and safety teams to ensure our systems are both capable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineering teams build the environments, evaluation systems, data pipelines, and tooling that make all of this possible: from realistic agentic training environments and scalable code data generation, to human data collection platforms and production training operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Full-Stack Software Engineer within Reinforcement Learning, you&#39;ll build the platforms, tools, and interfaces that power RL environment creation, data collection, and training observability. Our ability to train frontier models depends on generating diverse, high-quality training data — and the products you build are what make that possible for researchers, vendors, and data labelers alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a software engineering role embedded within research teams. You&#39;ll own product surfaces end-to-end — from backend services and APIs to web UIs that internal researchers, external vendors, and data labelers rely on daily. You don&#39;t need a background in ML research — what matters is strong full-stack engineering skills and the ability to build polished, reliable products in a fast-moving environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and extend web platforms for RL environment creation, management, and quality review — including environment configuration, versioning, and validation workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop vendor-facing interfaces and tooling that enable external partners to create, submit, and iterate on training environments with minimal friction&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement platforms for human data collection at scale, including labeling workflows, quality assurance systems, and feedback mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build evaluation dashboards and observability UIs that give researchers real-time insight into environment quality, training run health, and reward signal integrity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create backend services and APIs that connect environment authoring tools, data collection systems, and RL training infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and expand scalable code data generation pipelines, creating diverse programming tasks with robust reward signals across languages and difficulty levels&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop onboarding automation and documentation tooling so new vendors and internal users can ramp up quickly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate with RL researchers, data operations, and vendor management teams to translate their needs into well-designed product experiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have strong software engineering fundamentals with full-stack experience&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are proficient in Python and modern web frameworks (React, TypeScript, or similar)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience building and shipping user-facing products, internal tools, or developer platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can own a product surface end-to-end — backend, frontend, API design, database schema&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience with relational databases, API design patterns, and authentication/authorization systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about UX and can build interfaces that are intuitive for both technical and non-technical users&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Communicate clearly with researchers, operations teams, and engineers and can translate ambiguous requirements into well-scoped work&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are motivated by building excellent platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Operate with high agency: you identify what needs to be done and drive it forward independently&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thrive in a fast-paced environment where priorities shift and new problems emerge regularly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about Anthropic&#39;s mission to build safe, beneficial AI and want your work to contribute to that

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Really, really fast. The People Products team exists to support Anthropic’s mission by defining the blueprint for AI at work. We help hire the best person in the world for every job, ensure manager effectiveness, ramp new hires successfully, and ensure that we apply first principles thinking in how we shape Anthropic’s culture through the tools we build. We cover the entire employee lifecycle from hiring to onboarding, teamwork, and promotions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work directly with Claude, with access to capabilities no external team has, on problems that are genuinely unsolved. You’ll move fast — prototype to production in days or weeks. We believe in cross-functional thinkers who can reason across product, design, and engineering. You’ll be given high autonomy, own your decisions, and ship constantly. If you’ve experienced the pain of bad people practices and want to be the person who fixes them at the most consequential AI company in the world, this is that job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build full-stack end-to-end across the People Products portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement AI-native workflows: build tools, evals, prompts, and products. You’ll help define what is possible in applied AI for people processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work directly with internal stakeholders — HR teams, recruiters, managers — to understand problems, gather feedback, and iterate quickly without waiting for requirements to be handed down. No gatekeeping, you are expected to talk to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product and architecture decisions independently in a low-structure environment: knowing when to cut scope, when to ship, and when to ask for input.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contribute ideas for how the team works, what it builds, and where applied AI can have the most leverage in people workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Derive joy from hard work and the act of creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have shipped LLM-native features or applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are experienced enough to build big features independently, and make great architectural decisions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are self-sufficient end-to-end: you can go from idea to production without needing a designer, PM, or architect to unblock you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Move fast without cutting corners: you hold a high quality bar and know how to make smart tradeoffs under time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engage directly with users and criticism: you’re comfortable talking to internal customers, hearing hard feedback, and incorporating it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are genuinely mission-driven: you care about the intersection of AI and people practices, not just the technical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are a collaborative, supportive teammate: you bring people along, communicate clearly about tradeoffs, and make the people around you better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with MCP (Model Context Protocol) or prior experience building Claude or LLM integrations in production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background at an AI-native company or in a product-focused 0-&amp;gt;1 engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with HR tech platforms such as Greenhouse, Workday, or Rippling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses.

Whether you&#39;re building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Full Stack Engineer to build the Vercel Dashboard, the control plane for every Vercel user. You&#39;ll own the core surface through which developers and teams interact with Vercel, from first login through daily use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard is where the self-driving aspect of Vercel&#39;s Cloud comes to life. Today, it&#39;s a project listing page. We&#39;re turning it into a personalized, agent-powered surface that proactively helps users ship and stay on best practices.

Profile, measure, and optimize aggressively. Every interaction should feel instant&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build agent-facing surfaces: the UI and API layers where agents surface errors, suggest fixes, update config, and keep users on best practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product area teams (Billing, CI/CD, Observability, etc.) to ensure their pages integrate cleanly into the Dashboard shell and follow shared patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship incrementally and continuously.

You&#39;re strong across the stack: modern frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and backend (APIs, databases, services)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ve built products for developers or technical users.

You naturally build reusable abstractions, composable components, and clean APIs rather than one-off solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re comfortable with ambiguity. This is a new team building a new product direction. You can take a rough problem statement and turn it into shipped code&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You use AI tools in your own development workflow and have opinions on how they should work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You ship fast without sacrificing quality. You bias toward iteration and production feedback over long planning cycles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate clearly and collaborate well with Product, Design, and other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working on platform or horizontal teams where you built shared infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open source projects, especially in the React or Next.js ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $196,000-$294,000.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Developer Security team secures Coinbase&#39;s software supply chain and builds automation to find and fix vulnerabilities at scale. We own artifact scanning, dependency analysis, vulnerability management, and security agents that automate remediation across the company. As a Software Engineer on this team, you will build and ship features across these systems. You will work with engineers across Coinbase to make security a natural part of how they build software.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain services to meet critical product and business needs using Golang.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver features and small-to-medium projects end-to-end: design, implementation, deployment, and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Author technical design documents and break down complex features into individual tasks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Improve code quality and address technical debt within your ownership area.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in on-call rotations, code reviews, and incident response.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with engineers, product managers, and security partners to deliver on the team&#39;s roadmap.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At least 2 years of experience in software engineering.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have built, deployed, and maintained production services and understand service-oriented architecture.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You write high quality, well tested code.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can author technical design documents and break down features into discrete tasks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You actively use modern tooling (including AI-assisted development) to ship faster and learn new domains quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are passionate about building an open financial system that brings the world together.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with security tooling or security-adjacent engineering (e.g., SLSA, Sigstore, artifact scanning, SBOM).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Artifactory, Xray, or similar supply chain security platforms.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, Postgres, MongoDB, gRPC.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS or GCP).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have worked at a company during a period of rapid growth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job #: 75879&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pay Transparency Notice:&amp;nbsp; Depending on your work location, the target annual salary for this position can range from $&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;152,405&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to $179,300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;+ target bonus + target equity + benefits (including medical, dental, vision and 401(k)). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;fortidlp-input-element-parent&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Transparency Notice&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Depending on your work location, the target annual &lt;strong&gt;base &lt;/strong&gt;salary for this position can range as detailed below.

It��s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is rebuilding core financial primitives—trading, payments, banking, lending—on blockchain, as well as developing new crypto products.

Identity platform and services need to evolve to enable this strategic shift from single product to multi-product. In this role, you will re-architect the Identity systems to enable Dropbox’s success as a multi-product company. You will contribute to large scale distributed systems design, API design, phased data migrations, persistent storage design and other foundational work that not only helps to develop the Identity Platform services at scale but also lends itself for ease of operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95lz89zy6z71zz79zz84zz68zyz69zupz72zz79zcz69zz76zkz79zp1z66ztz67zxz71zz89zz86zz71z&quot;&gt;Our Engineering Career Framework is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attrlink url author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95lz89zy6z71zz79zz84zz68zyz69zupz72zz79zcz69zz76zkz79zp1z66ztz67zxz71zz89zz86zz71z&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;attrlink&quot; href=&quot;https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-target-href=&quot;https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;viewable by anyone outside the company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95lz89zy6z71zz79zz84zz68zyz69zupz72zz79zcz69zz76zkz79zp1z66ztz67zxz71zz89zz86zz71z&quot;&gt; and describes what’s expected for our engineers at each of our career levels.
