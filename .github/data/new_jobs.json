    "job_description": "About the team\n\nThe Safety Systems org ensures that OpenAI’s most capable models can be responsibly developed and deployed. We build evaluations, safeguards, and safety frameworks that help our models behave as intended in real-world settings.\n\nThe Preparedness team is an important part of the Safety Systems https://openai.com/safety/safety-systems org at OpenAI, and is guided by OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/.\n\nFrontier AI models have the potential to benefit all of humanity, but also pose increasingly severe risks. To ensure that AI promotes positive change, the Preparedness team helps us prepare for the development of increasingly capable frontier AI models. This team is tasked with identifying, tracking, and preparing for catastrophic risks related to frontier AI models.\n\nThe mission of the Preparedness team is to:\n\n 1. Closely monitor and predict the evolving capabilities of frontier AI systems, with an eye towards risks whose impact could be catastrophic\n\n 2. Ensure we have concrete procedures, infrastructure and partnerships to mitigate these risks and to safely handle the development of powerful AI systems\n\nPreparedness tightly connects capability assessment, evaluations, and internal red teaming, and mitigations for frontier models, as well as overall coordination on AGI preparedness. This is fast paced, exciting work that has far reaching importance for the company and for society.\n\nAbout the role\n\nThis role leads the Automated Red Teaming (ART) effort: building scalable, research-driven systems that continuously discover failure modes in our models and mitigations — and translate those findings into actionable, production-facing improvements. The goal is to maximize counterfactual reduction in expected harm by finding the highest-leverage, least-covered weaknesses early and reliably.\n\nIn this role you will\n\nYou will own the research and technical direction for automated red teaming across catastrophic risk areas, with an initial emphasis on:\n\n - Automated classifier jailbreak discovery (cyber and bio)\n\n - Automated bio threat-development elicitation (worst-feasible planning uplift)\n\n - CoT monitoring evasion probing (and adjacent loss-of-control evaluations)\n\nYou will partner tightly with:\n\n - Vertical risk teams (Cyber, Bio, Loss of Control) to define threat models, prioritize targets, and land mitigations\n\n - The Classifiers team to turn discovered attacks into training data, evals, and measurable robustness gains\n\n - Product / eng / safety stakeholders to ensure ART outputs are operationally useful (not just interesting)\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Feel a strong pull toward AI safety, and you’re motivated by reducing real-world catastrophic risk (not just publishing cool results).\n\n - Love breaking systems (responsibly) — you get energy from finding weird, high-severity failure modes and turning them into concrete fixes.\n\n - Have strong applied research instincts, especially around evaluations: you’re good at designing experiments that are reproducible, interpretable, and hard to fool.\n\n - Bring hands-on experience with LLMs and agents, including multi-turn behaviors, tool use, and the ways models adapt to constraints.\n\n - Are comfortable building scalable automation, not just prototypes — you can turn red-teaming ideas into pipelines that run continuously and produce high-signal outputs.\n\n - Have solid software engineering fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, testing discipline) and you can work effectively in a production-adjacent environment.\n\n - Think in threat models and incentives, and you naturally ask “what would an attacker do next?” or “how would this fail under pressure?”\n\n - Can translate messy findings into action, communicating clearly with researchers, engineers, product, and policy — and driving alignment on what to fix first.\n\n - Care about efficiency and prioritization, and you’re happy to say “no” to low-leverage work to focus on what moves the risk needle.\n\n - (Nice to have) Experience in adversarial ML, security research / red teaming, abuse prevention systems, or large-scale eval infrastructure.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products.

    "job_description": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nChatGPT is a rapidly evolving system: new capabilities ship continuously, product surfaces change quickly, and usage patterns shift week-to-week. Supporting that pace requires infrastructure that can handle real production constraints—high concurrency, unpredictable traffic patterns, complex dependency graphs, and frequent change.\n\nThe job of ChatGPT Infrastructure is to build and operate the platforms that make fast iteration possible without breaking performance or reliability. We design the shared systems, data paths, rollout mechanisms, and reliability guardrails that teams rely on when shipping changes to ChatGPT at scale.\n\nWe focus on high-leverage infrastructure: primitives and “golden paths” that turn hard-won operational lessons into defaults—so engineers don’t need to rediscover the same failure modes, latency pitfalls, or integration issues each time they build something new.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re hiring Senior and Staff engineers to design and build infrastructure systems that sit underneath ChatGPT and multiply the effectiveness of the teams building user experiences.\n\nThis is not a “keep the lights on” role. It’s a platform-building role: you’ll define interfaces, develop core abstractions, and create tooling that makes safe, fast iteration the norm. Your work will show up as less friction, fewer regressions, better performance, and systems that scale gracefully as the product expands.\n\n\nWHERE YOU CAN HAVE IMPACT\n\nYou might work on one or more of these areas (without being locked into any single lane):\n\n - Platform foundations & frameworks: core libraries, service frameworks, and shared components that standardize how systems are built, integrated, and evolved.\n\n - Scalability & performance primitives: patterns and infrastructure that reduce tail latency, improve throughput, and keep costs predictable as demand grows.\n\n - Reliability guardrails: mechanisms that prevent outages by design—rate limiting, load shedding, dependency isolation, backpressure, safe fallbacks, and “make it hard to regress” controls.\n\n - Developer productivity via golden paths: paved roads for common workflows (data access patterns, service integration patterns, request lifecycle patterns) that are fast, safe, and easy to use.\n\n - Observability & debugging systems: instrumentation, metrics models, and investigative tooling that turn “it’s slow” into a precise, actionable diagnosis.\n\n - Safe change management: deployment and rollout systems that support rapid iteration with confidence—progressive delivery, automated verification, and fast rollback strategies.\n\n - Interface and contract design across boundaries: clean APIs and stable contracts that reduce coupling and allow independent evolution across a complex ecosystem.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Build and evolve infrastructure platforms that many engineers and services depend on.\n\n - Translate messy real-world constraints into clean abstractions: simple APIs, enforceable contracts, safe defaults.\n\n - Drive improvements in reliability and performance through principled design, measurement, and iterative hardening.\n\n - Partner across engineering and product to identify systemic pain points and turn them into reusable solutions.\n\n - Own outcomes end-to-end: design → implementation → rollout → operational maturity.\n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\n\n - Experience building and operating large-scale distributed systems in production (high throughput, concurrency, and failure handling).\n\n - Strong fundamentals in systems design, including caching, consistency, queueing/backpressure, and resilient dependency management.\n\n - Ability to reason about performance (latency distributions, tail behavior, bottlenecks) and translate that into concrete engineering work.\n\n - Track record of building platforms or shared infrastructure that improves velocity and correctness for other teams.\n\n - Strong communication and collaboration skills—aligning on interfaces, navigating tradeoffs, and driving cross-team execution.\n\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\n - Experience designing paved roads / golden paths (frameworks, libraries, self-serve tooling) that shape engineering behavior at scale.\n\n - Deep understanding of reliability techniques: graceful degradation, circuit breakers, load shedding, rate limiting, and fault isolation.\n\n - Experience building systems for safe iteration: progressive delivery, correctness checks, automated rollout gates, and production validation.\n\n - Strong instincts for API and contract design—how to create interfaces that are stable, evolvable, and hard to misuse.\n\n - Prior work that demonstrates “force multiplier” impact: enabling many teams through a small number of well-chosen primitives.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s Reinforcement Learning organization leads the research and development that trains Claude to be capable, reliable, and safe. We&#39;ve contributed to every Claude model, with significant impacts on the autonomy and coding capabilities of our most advanced models. Our work spans developing systems that enable models to use computers effectively, advancing code generation through reinforcement learning, pioneering fundamental RL research for large language models, and building scalable training methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RL org is organized around four key goals: solving the science of long-horizon tasks and continual learning, scaling RL data and environments to be comprehensive and diverse, automating software engineering end-to-end, and training the frontier production model. We collaborate closely with Anthropic&#39;s alignment and safety teams to ensure our systems are both capable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineering teams build the environments, evaluation systems, data pipelines, and tooling that make all of this possible: from realistic agentic training environments and scalable code data generation, to human data collection platforms and production training operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Full-Stack Software Engineer within Reinforcement Learning, you&#39;ll build the platforms, tools, and interfaces that power RL environment creation, data collection, and training observability. Our ability to train frontier models depends on generating diverse, high-quality training data — and the products you build are what make that possible for researchers, vendors, and data labelers alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a software engineering role embedded within research teams. You&#39;ll own product surfaces end-to-end — from backend services and APIs to web UIs that internal researchers, external vendors, and data labelers rely on daily. You don&#39;t need a background in ML research — what matters is strong full-stack engineering skills and the ability to build polished, reliable products in a fast-moving environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and extend web platforms for RL environment creation, management, and quality review — including environment configuration, versioning, and validation workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop vendor-facing interfaces and tooling that enable external partners to create, submit, and iterate on training environments with minimal friction&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement platforms for human data collection at scale, including labeling workflows, quality assurance systems, and feedback mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build evaluation dashboards and observability UIs that give researchers real-time insight into environment quality, training run health, and reward signal integrity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create backend services and APIs that connect environment authoring tools, data collection systems, and RL training infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and expand scalable code data generation pipelines, creating diverse programming tasks with robust reward signals across languages and difficulty levels&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop onboarding automation and documentation tooling so new vendors and internal users can ramp up quickly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate with RL researchers, data operations, and vendor management teams to translate their needs into well-designed product experiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have strong software engineering fundamentals with full-stack experience&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are proficient in Python and modern web frameworks (React, TypeScript, or similar)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience building and shipping user-facing products, internal tools, or developer platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can own a product surface end-to-end — backend, frontend, API design, database schema&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience with relational databases, API design patterns, and authentication/authorization systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about UX and can build interfaces that are intuitive for both technical and non-technical users&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Communicate clearly with researchers, operations teams, and engineers and can translate ambiguous requirements into well-scoped work&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are motivated by building excellent platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Operate with high agency: you identify what needs to be done and drive it forward independently&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thrive in a fast-paced environment where priorities shift and new problems emerge regularly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about Anthropic&#39;s mission to build safe, beneficial AI and want your work to contribute to that goal&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building data collection, labeling, or annotation platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background building multi-tenant platforms with role-based access and vendor management workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with cloud infrastructure (GCP or AWS), Docker, and CI/CD pipelines&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with LLM training, fine-tuning, or evaluation workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with async Python frameworks (Trio, asyncio) or high-throughput API design&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background building dashboards, monitoring, or observability tooling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience working with external vendors or partners on technical integrations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative Projects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building a unified platform for human data collection that integrates labeling workflows, vendor management, and quality assurance for complex agentic tasks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Developing vendor onboarding automation that handles Docker registry access, API token management, and environment validation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Creating evaluation and observability dashboards that catch reward hacks, measure environment difficulty, and provide real-time feedback during production training&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building environment quality review workflows that allow researchers to browse, grade, and provide feedback on training environments&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Developing automated environment quality pipelines that validate correctness and difficulty calibration before deployment to production training&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building internal tools for browsing and analyzing training run results, environment statistics, and data collection

This role owns the researcher experience with that tooling — both the day-to-day support and the longer-term product vision.

The work is highly operational—you&#39;ll be deeply involved in keeping our production models training smoothly, which means being responsive to incidents, flexible about priorities, and comfortable with uncertainty. During launches, the team often works extended hours and may need to respond to issues on evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, this operational intensity comes with extraordinary learning opportunities.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Frontier Red Team (FRT) is a small, focused technical research team within Anthropic&#39;s Policy organization. Our goal is to make the entire world safer in an era of advanced AI by understanding what these systems can do and building the defenses that matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2026, we&#39;re focused on researching and ensuring safety with self-improving, highly autonomous AI systems, especially ones related to cyberphysical capabilities. See our previous related work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/&quot;&gt;cyberdefense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2025/project-fetch/&quot;&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2025/project-vend-2/&quot;&gt;Project Vend&lt;/a&gt;. This is early-stage, high-conviction research with the potential for outsized impact.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the last year, we&#39;ve seen compelling signs that LLMs and agents are increasingly capable of novel cyber capabilities. We think 2026 will be the year where models reach expert-level, even superhuman, in several cybersecurity domains. This is a novel and massive threat surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Research Scientist on FRT focusing on cyber, you&#39;ll build the tools and frameworks needed to defend the world against advanced AI-enabled cyber threats. Senior candidates will have the opportunity to shape and grow Anthropic&#39;s cyberdefense research program, working with Security, Safeguards, Policy, and other partner teams. This work sits at the intersection of AI capabilities research, cybersecurity, and policy—what we learn directly shapes how Anthropic and the world prepare for AI-enabled cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is applied research with real-world stakes. Your work will inform decisions at the highest levels of the company, contribute to demonstrations that shape policy discourse, and build the technical defenses that we will need for a future of increasingly powerful AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop systems, tools, and frameworks for AI-empowered cybersecurity, such as autonomous vulnerability discovery and remediation, malware detection and management, network hardening, and pentesting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and run experiments to elicit and evaluate autonomous AI cyber capabilities in realistic scenarios&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build infrastructure for evaluating and enabling AI systems to operate in security environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate technical findings into compelling demonstrations and artifacts that inform policymakers and the public&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with external experts in cybersecurity, national security, and AI safety to scope and validate research directions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Senior candidates will also set research strategy, define what problems are worth solving, own the technical roadmap, and manage relationships with cross-functional partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building frameworks and tools that enable AI models to autonomously find and patch vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Running purple-team simulations where AI defenders compete against AI attackers in network environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pointing autonomous AI systems at real-world security challenges (bug bounties, CTFs etc.) to characterize risks, defensive potential, and compare to human experts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building demonstrations of frontier AI cyber capabilities for policy stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have deep expertise in cybersecurity or security research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are driven to find solutions to complex, high-stakes problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience doing technical research with LLM-based agents or autonomous systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong software engineering skills, particularly in Python&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can own entire problems end-to-end, including both technical and non-technical components&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and run experiments quickly, iterating fast toward useful results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in collaborative environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care deeply about AI safety and want your work to have real-world impact on how humanity navigates advanced AI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable working on sensitive projects that require discretion and integrity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have proven ability to lead cross-functional security initiatives and navigate complex organizational dynamics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with offensive security research, vulnerability research, or exploit development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Research or professional experience applying LLMs to security problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record in competitive CTFs, bug bounties, or other security-related competitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building security tools or automation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of building demos or prototypes that communicate complex technical ideas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working with external stakeholders (policymakers, government, researchers)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with AI safety research and threat modeling for advanced AI systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$350,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$850,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, Anthropic is growing fast. Really, really fast. The People Products team exists to support Anthropic’s mission by defining the blueprint for AI at work. We help hire the best person in the world for every job, ensure manager effectiveness, ramp new hires successfully, and ensure that we apply first principles thinking in how we shape Anthropic’s culture through the tools we build. We cover the entire employee lifecycle from hiring to onboarding, teamwork, and promotions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work directly with Claude, with access to capabilities no external team has, on problems that are genuinely unsolved. You’ll move fast — prototype to production in days or weeks. We believe in cross-functional thinkers who can reason across product, design, and engineering. You’ll be given high autonomy, own your decisions, and ship constantly. If you’ve experienced the pain of bad people practices and want to be the person who fixes them at the most consequential AI company in the world, this is that job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build full-stack end-to-end across the People Products portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement AI-native workflows: build tools, evals, prompts, and products. You’ll help define what is possible in applied AI for people processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work directly with internal stakeholders — HR teams, recruiters, managers — to understand problems, gather feedback, and iterate quickly without waiting for requirements to be handed down. No gatekeeping, you are expected to talk to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product and architecture decisions independently in a low-structure environment: knowing when to cut scope, when to ship, and when to ask for input.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contribute ideas for how the team works, what it builds, and where applied AI can have the most leverage in people workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Derive joy from hard work and the act of creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have shipped LLM-native features or applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are experienced enough to build big features independently, and make great architectural decisions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are self-sufficient end-to-end: you can go from idea to production without needing a designer, PM, or architect to unblock you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Move fast without cutting corners: you hold a high quality bar and know how to make smart tradeoffs under time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engage directly with users and criticism: you’re comfortable talking to internal customers, hearing hard feedback, and incorporating it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are genuinely mission-driven: you care about the intersection of AI and people practices, not just the technical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are a collaborative, supportive teammate: you bring people along, communicate clearly about tradeoffs, and make the people around you better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with MCP (Model Context Protocol) or prior experience building Claude or LLM integrations in production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background at an AI-native company or in a product-focused 0-&amp;gt;1 engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with HR tech platforms such as Greenhouse, Workday, or Rippling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone&#39;s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stripe is beloved by developers for the simplicity of our APIs, the thoroughness of our documentation, and our focus on developer experience. The Technical Solutions Engineering (TSE) team is the glue that supports our developer-users and champions developer experience as being central to the overall experience of our users. TSE interacts directly with developer-users more than any other team at Stripe, so your role will have a significant impact on what Stripe is known for and values most. When we do our job well, developers all over the world are able to smoothly launch and grow their businesses on Stripe, whether they’re integrating payments for the first time or building complex financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;TSEs understand the fundamentals of programming incredibly well and eagerly jump in and familiarize themselves with others’ code. You will do a wide variety of things, including explaining technical concepts about Stripe’s products, build and debug integrations with developers, and produce/improve guides that help our users solve particular problems to be successful with Stripe. You will interact with developers of all skill levels through a variety of mediums, enabling them to be successful when using Stripe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Early on, current team members will devote a large amount of time to teaching you and helping you get to a level of comfort and expertise with Stripe, its services, and how we interact with users. Later, we’d love for you to take on this role with others on the team and Stripes broadly, as teaching is a great way to learn and to reinforce what you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re someone who enjoys working with all kinds of code, is a fast researcher, a strong writer, and enthusiastic about helping others build mission-critical products with Stripe, we want to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate with a number of external developers and aid them in building their applications against Stripe’s infrastructure in a number of programming languages (including Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, NodeJS, .NET, ReactJS, React Native, Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Java for Android).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unblock external developers with their thorniest integration challenges through a variety of support channels including email, ticketing software, internal issue trackers, community platforms (like StackOverflow), and real-time chat software (like Slack and Discord)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain internal and external documentation, examples, integration demos, and code-snippets that demonstrate usage patterns of the Stripe infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify points of friction developers encounter and collaborate with engineering teams to make Stripe products better. Participate in a number of extended engineering teams’ regular planning sessions, design reviews, and development meetings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain a suite of internal support tooling for TSE and Stripe Support more broadly e.g. a retrieval augmented generation LLM-based Copilot tool or the Invoice Explainer Admin tool.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as a developer advocate and educational resource internal to the organization by regularly assembling training for non-developers internal to the organization and responding in real-time to product integration questions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This role is remote but requires candidates to be located in the Mountain or Pacific time zones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At least 4 years of full-stack software development experience, with a proven track record of building web or mobile applications that deliver high-quality user experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience explaining technical concepts, and would be comfortable explaining how Stripe works to both technical and non-technical audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understands how to write good, clean code in multiple programming languages, as well as how to read code that might not be quite as well written&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to help users during working hours in the region you are in. This may occasionally include providing weekend coverage for monitoring/supporting critical infrastructure, which TSEs are uniquely equipped to assist with given the team’s knowledge around Stripe’s products and active integrations. The team is largely remote, and we are very supportive of working arrangements that allow for family care and other needs to be met.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoys writing in a clear and quick manner&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;General software engineering skills are important to us, as we understand that new languages and frameworks can be learned if you understand the concepts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience teaching or coaching developers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfort working with a great deal of autonomy and limited supervision&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Degree in Computer Science, Software/Computer Engineering, or a related analytical field of study&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",

    "job_description": "&lt;p&gt;At MongoDB, we recognize that an inclusive workforce is the best way to broaden our perspectives, foster innovation, and enable a sustainable competitive advantage. Our ‘Next in Tech Summit’ is a virtual early identification opportunity for students who are passionate about exploring a career in Tech. All students are welcome to apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Summit application process leads to an interactive day of learning and culminates with the chance to interview for our Summer 2027 internships. During the Summit, attendees will connect with MongoDB employees from across the company, dive into our culture, and explore our Early Talent Programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are excited to offer two distinct tracks tailored to your career aspirations:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Developer track is for the bold creators and problem-solvers who are passionate about hands-on software engineering. Focusing on students studying Computer Science or related fields, this track offers a deep dive into the life of a builder. Whether you are interested in shipping high-impact, customer-facing products, optimizing low-level systems, developing internal tools for our global workforce, or architecting complex data engineering pipelines. If you enjoy solving complex challenges through code and want to see your work drive the world’s leading developer data platform, this track is for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Technology+ track is built for technical visionaries who want to apply their skills in specialized domains outside of software engineering. This track explores how technical expertise drives massive impact at the high-stakes intersection of technology and strategy.

    "job_description": "ABOUT US:\n\nNotion helps you build beautiful tools for your life's work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.\n\nIn-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\nYou'll own the quality bar for Notion AI products. You’ll work with product and engineering teams to build systems to define what “good” looks like, measure our progress, and drive changes to deliver reliable and high-quality AI experiences. Your work directly shapes how Notion's AI products behave for millions of users.\n\nThis isn't a traditional software engineering role. It’s an art & science role. You won't spend your days writing code. Instead, you'll focus on understanding and shaping how our AI products behave through context engineering, designing evaluation systems, and analyzing data. This team sits in our AI engineering team, working directly with engineering, product, design, and data.\n\nThis role is a unique blend of ops, strategy, and product thinking. Day to day, you'll live in production data, ship prompt fixes, run evals and, in effect, shape our quality strategy. As part of that you'll shape Notion's model strategy and work directly with frontier AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to evaluate and launch new models.\n\nWe're looking for problem-seeking generalists interested in 0 → 1: curious people with high agency who thrive in ambiguous, fast-moving product areas. We're building a product, but also building a new function. You'll have real ownership from day one and help write the playbook as we scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE:\n\n - Context engineering — Design, test, and iterate on system prompts, tool prompts, and context strategies that shape how Notion's AI products behave. Understand the nuances of how models respond to different context structures and use that knowledge to drive quality improvements directly.\n\n - Understand & debug — Live in production data: transcripts, logs, user feedback. Reproduce issues, identify root causes, and translate symptoms into actionable problem statements. Find signal in noisy data.\n\n - Build evals & Measurement — Design eval strategies, build datasets, run evaluations. Track quality over time. Identify issues before users do. Own the loop: define quality goals, create evals, test and improve\n\n - Evaluate and launch new models with leading research labs — Evaluate and launch models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. Benchmark across dimensions: quality, latency, cost, edge cases. Help shape Notion's model strategy based on real data.\n\n - Drive quality priorities — Work embedded with eng and product teams to surface the most important issues. Own the quality narrative: severity, frequency, what to fix and why. Be the voice of quality in the room.\n\n - Build tooling & systems — Help manage AI observability and eval platforms (e.g., Braintrust). Build the playbooks and tools that enable all teams at Notion to build AI products.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU’LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - Driver mentality — You treat problems as yours. If something's broken, it's your job to fix it, even if you didn't cause it. You have a bias to action.\n\n - Curiosity －You’re excited about exploring the “jagged frontier” of LLM capabilities and how AI products meet reality\n\n - Analytical instinct — Your first move is to look at data. You can find signal in noise.\n\n - Comfortable working with data — You can self-serve insights from large datasets, whether through SQL, coding agents, or other tools.\n\n - Clear communication — You can explain complex issues simply.\n\n - Experience with LLMs, prompting, or AI products\n   \n   \n\n\nNICE TO HAVE'S:\n\n - Backgrounds in engineering, product, data science, research, consulting\n\n - You've built something on your own to solve a problem — side project, startup, tool, whatever\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.\n\nNotion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $98,000 - $140,000 per year.\n\nBy clicking \"Submit Application\", I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion's Global Recruiting Privacy Policy https://notion.notion.site/Notion-Global-Recruiting-Privacy-Policy-fc3eb4e829354a26a2bb6fd5e289b550?pvs=74 and NYLL 144 https://notion.notion.site/Ashby-AI-Bias-Audit-2b0efdeead05803bbbfae159ec86c528.\n\n#LI-Onsite",

    "job_description": "Join the engineering teams that bring OpenAI’s ideas safely to the world!!\n\nThe Applied Engineering team works across research, engineering, product, and design to bring OpenAI’s technology to consumers and businesses. We seek to learn from deployment and distribute the benefits of AI, while ensuring that this powerful tool is used responsibly and safely. Safety is more important to us than unfettered growth.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe’re building the observability product for OpenAI—from scalable infrastructure to a rich, AI-powered UI. Our systems ingest over petabytes of logs and billions of time series metrics across our fleet. We're now layering intelligence on top—think agents that summarize SEVs, auto-generate dashboards, or help engineers debug through notebook-like UIs.\n\nWe’re hiring software engineers across the stack—infra, backend, and product. You’ll join a small, gritty team building both foundational infra and novel internal tools to make OpenAI's production systems reliable, performant, and observable.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\n - Own core observability infrastructure, including distributed logging, time series, and trace storage\n\n - Build AI-native tools that help engineers detect, understand, and resolve issues autonomously.\n\n - Contribute to UI experiences like dashboards, notebooking, or interactive debugging\n\n - Collaborate closely with engineers, researchers, user ops, and other teams across the company to build the next generation observability product\n\nYou Might Be a Fit If You:\n\n - Have operated large-scale distributed systems in production.

DLT helps data engineering teams simplify ETL (extract-transform-load) development and management with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for monitoring and recovery. DLT optimizes pipeline execution by logical optimization through query transformations, and physical optimization such as instance type selection and vertical/horizontal autoscaling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as part of DLT, we have a new catalyst optimization layer, enzyme, designed specifically to speed up the ETL process and make declarative ETL computation possible by incrementally computing and materializing the intermediate results. Enzyme can create and keep up-to-date a materialization of the results of a given query stored in a Delta table. Enzyme does this by using a cost model to choose between a variety of techniques that borrow from traditional literature on the maintenance of materialized views, delta-to-delta streaming, and manual ETL patterns commonly used by our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a part of the DLT team, there are opportunities to design and implement in many areas that leapfrog existing systems:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Query compilation and optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distributed query execution and scheduling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vectorized engine execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Resource Management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transaction coordination&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Efficient storage structures (encoding, indexes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Automatic physical data optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What We Look For:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PhD in databases or systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and performance optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motivated by delivering customer value and influence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Range Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Databricks is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.

As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-sheets-root=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you&#39;re building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Full Stack Engineer to build the Vercel Dashboard, the control plane for every Vercel user. You&#39;ll own the core surface through which developers and teams interact with Vercel, from first login through daily use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard is where the self-driving aspect of Vercel&#39;s Cloud comes to life. Today, it&#39;s a project listing page. We&#39;re turning it into a personalized, agent-powered surface that proactively helps users ship and stay on best practices. This is a foundational role: you&#39;ll be one of the first engineers on a new team, working alongside our current tech lead to rearchitect and rebuild the Dashboard from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll work across the stack: building fast, polished UI on the frontend and the APIs, data layers, and services that power personalization, agent experiences, and real-time push surfaces on the backend. The Dashboard must be the reference implementation of Vercel&#39;s own platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and own core Dashboard infrastructure: the shell, navigation, layout system, and shared components that every product area builds within&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect and implement the backend services and APIs that power the Dashboard, including personalization, notifications, and agent-powered experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive performance as a core feature. Profile, measure, and optimize aggressively. Every interaction should feel instant&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build agent-facing surfaces: the UI and API layers where agents surface errors, suggest fixes, update config, and keep users on best practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product area teams (Billing, CI/CD, Observability, etc.) to ensure their pages integrate cleanly into the Dashboard shell and follow shared patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship incrementally and continuously. This is a living product that improves every week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4+ years of experience as a software engineer building user-facing products. You&#39;re strong across the stack: modern frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and backend (APIs, databases, services)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ve built products for developers or technical users. You understand the expectations of this audience and you hold yourself to the same bar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You think in systems. You naturally build reusable abstractions, composable components, and clean APIs rather than one-off solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re comfortable with ambiguity. This is a new team building a new product direction. You can take a rough problem statement and turn it into shipped code&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You use AI tools in your own development workflow and have opinions on how they should work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You ship fast without sacrificing quality. You bias toward iteration and production feedback over long planning cycles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate clearly and collaborate well with Product, Design, and other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working on platform or horizontal teams where you built shared infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open source projects, especially in the React or Next.js ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $196,000-$294,000.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up.

    "job_description": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe Safety Systems org ensures that OpenAI’s most capable models can be responsibly developed and deployed. We build evaluations, safeguards, and safety frameworks that help our models behave as intended in real-world settings.\n\nThe Preparedness team is an important part of the Safety Systems https://openai.com/safety/safety-systems org at OpenAI, and is guided by OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/.\n\nFrontier AI models have the potential to benefit all of humanity, but also pose increasingly severe risks. To ensure that AI promotes positive change, the Preparedness team helps us prepare for the development of increasingly capable frontier AI models. This team is tasked with identifying, tracking, and preparing for catastrophic risks related to frontier AI models.\n\nThe mission of the Preparedness team is to:\n\n 1. Closely monitor and predict the evolving capabilities of frontier AI systems, with an eye towards risks whose impact could be catastrophic\n\n 2. Ensure we have concrete procedures, infrastructure and partnerships to mitigate these risks and to safely handle the development of powerful AI systems\n\nPreparedness tightly connects capability assessment, evaluations, and internal red teaming, and mitigations for frontier models, as well as overall coordination on AGI preparedness. This is fast paced, exciting work that has far reaching importance for the company and for society.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nModels are becoming increasingly capable—moving from tools that assist humans to agents that can plan, execute, and adapt in the real world. As we push toward AGI, cybersecurity becomes one of the most important and urgent frontiers: the same systems that can accelerate productivity can also accelerate exploitation.\n\nAs a Researcher for cybersecurity risks, you will help design and implement an end-to-end mitigation stack to reduce severe cyber misuse across OpenAI’s products. This role requires strong technical depth and close cross-functional collaboration to ensure safeguards are enforceable, scalable, and effective. You’ll contribute directly to building protections that remain robust as products, model capabilities, and attacker behaviors evolve.\n\n\nIN THIS ROLE, YOU WILL:\n\n - Design and implement mitigation components for model-enabled cybersecurity misuse—spanning prevention, monitoring, detection, and enforcement—under the guidance of senior technical and risk leadership.\n\n - Integrate safeguards across product surfaces in partnership with product and engineering teams, helping ensure protections are consistent, low-latency, and scale with usage and new model capabilities.\n\n - Evaluate technical trade-offs within the cybersecurity risk domain (coverage, latency, model utility, and user privacy) and propose pragmatic, testable solutions.\n\n - Collaborate closely with risk and threat modeling partners to align mitigation design with anticipated attacker behaviors and high-impact misuse scenarios.\n\n - Execute rigorous testing and red-teaming workflows, helping stress-test the mitigation stack against evolving threats (e.g., novel exploits, tool-use chains, automated attack workflows) and across different product surfaces—then iterate based on findings.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU:\n\n - Have a passion for AI safety and are motivated to make cutting-edge AI models safer for real-world use.\n\n - Bring demonstrated experience in deep learning and transformer models.\n\n - Are proficient with frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\n - Possess a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles.\n\n - Are familiar with methods for training and fine-tuning large language models, including distillation, supervised fine-tuning, and policy optimization.\n\n - Excel at working collaboratively with cross-functional teams across research, security, policy, product, and engineering.\n\n - Have significant experience designing and deploying technical safeguards for abuse prevention, detection, and enforcement at scale.\n\n - (Nice to have) Bring background knowledge in cybersecurity or adjacent fields.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA. No response will be provided to inquiries unrelated to job posting compliance.\n\nWe are committed to providing reasonable accommodations to applicants with disabilities, and requests can be made via this link https://form.asana.com/?k=bQ7w9h3iexRlicUdWRiwvg&d=57018692298241.\n\nOpenAI Global Applicant Privacy Policy https://cdn.openai.com/policies/global-employee-and-contractor-privacy-policy.pdf\n\nAt OpenAI, we believe artificial intelligence has the potential to help people solve immense global challenges, and we want the upside of AI to be widely shared.

    "job_description": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe Codex App team builds and maintains the Codex desktop app and IDE extension — the primary ways developers interact with Codex. Our goal is to make AI feel like a real software engineering teammate inside real workflows: editing code, running tasks, reviewing changes, and coordinating long-running work.\n\nWe sit at the intersection of research, product, and design. We ship quickly, learn from real usage, and continuously refine both the experience and the harness that connects users to the model.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re hiring a Frontend Software Engineer to build a top-tier desktop experience and push forward the interface for working with agents. This is a craft-heavy role: you’ll partner closely with design to prototype, iterate, and polish new interaction models — then turn them into reliable, high-performance product.\n\nYou’ll help define what great looks like for “human ↔ agent” collaboration: what belongs in the UI, how state is represented, how progress and uncertainty are communicated, and how users stay oriented across long-running and multi-step work.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Build and ship polished, high-performance UI across the Codex desktop app and IDE extension.\n\n - Partner tightly with design to turn prototypes into production-quality experiences (layout, motion, typography, interaction details).\n\n - Iterate on future interfaces for interacting with agents: delegation, task timelines, status/progress, handoffs, review, and control surfaces.\n\n - Own frontend architecture decisions (component systems, state management, navigation, rendering performance).\n\n - Improve quality and reliability through testing, instrumentation, and thoughtful UX for failure modes.\n\n - Collaborate with platform/model/backend partners to integrate new capabilities into cohesive product flows.\n   \n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE HERE IF YOU\n\n - Have strong experience with modern frontend stacks (React, TypeScript) and a high bar for UI craft.\n\n - Love design engineering: sweating the details while keeping velocity.\n\n - Have built desktop-caliber product experiences (Electron or similar), and care about performance, responsiveness, and “it just feels right.”\n\n - Enjoy exploring ambiguous problems and iterating rapidly with design and product.\n\n - Think in end-to-end workflows, not isolated screens.\n\n - Have experience with developer tools or IDE extensions (nice-to-have).\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

We build product experiences end-to-end, and we care equally about usability, performance, and reliability.\n\nOur stack is centered on a TypeScript/Node/Electron application that interfaces with external systems including the Codex CLI and app server (Rust). Building great features here often means designing clean boundaries between UI, local services, and native processes — and making the whole system observable and resilient.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re hiring a Full Stack Software Engineer to build and evolve the systems that power the Codex desktop app and IDE extension. “Full stack” here means owning flows from UI → Node/TypeScript backend layers → IPC/process orchestration → integration with Rust services.\n\nThis is a product-minded role. You’ll help define workflows, pick the right abstractions, and ship features that feel fast and dependable in real developer environments.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Build end-to-end features across the Electron app (UI + Node/TypeScript backend layers).\n\n - Design robust integrations with the Codex CLI and app server (Rust), including process lifecycle, streaming output, and error handling.\n\n - Own IPC architecture and patterns (renderer/main boundaries, message schemas, backpressure, safety, debugging).\n\n - Build systems for orchestration: long-running tasks, incremental progress updates, cancellation, retries, and state synchronization.\n\n - Improve reliability, observability, and performance (logging/tracing/metrics, profiling, crash/debug tooling).\n\n - Partner with design and product to turn ambiguous needs into crisp, shippable workflows.\n   \n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE HERE IF YOU\n\n - Have strong TypeScript/Node fundamentals and enjoy owning product features end-to-end.\n\n - Have experience with Electron or desktop app architecture (renderer/main separation, performance pitfalls, packaging/release concerns).\n\n - Are comfortable integrating with native processes/services (e.g., Rust) and designing clean, testable boundaries.\n\n - Know (or are excited to learn) IPC patterns and distributed-systems-like thinking applied locally: message ordering, buffering, backpressure, retries, idempotency.\n\n - Bring strong product judgment and enjoy iterating based on real usage and feedback.\n\n - Have experience with developer tools, CLIs, or IDE integrations (nice-to-have).\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

This role will partner cross-functionally as a trusted advisor to various leaders and teams across Verkada to drive inorganic growth opportunities (including M&amp;amp;A and partnerships), as well as organic strategic initiatives, while maintaining operational excellence, helping us reach the next level of scale and operating sophistication in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct market research and competitive analysis to identify industry trends, potential acquisition targets, and partnership opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in due diligence processes, including data analysis, financial review, and coordination with cross-functional teams (Finance, Product, Legal, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track and analyze key performance indicators for strategic projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare summaries, reports, and updates for senior leadership and executive team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to strategic finance special projects as needed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-4+ years of top tier professional experience.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re coming to us from a Strategic Finance, Business Operations, FP&amp;amp;A, or other highly analytical role at a fast growing startup, and may have begun your career in investing, management consulting, and/or investment banking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High analytical horsepower paired with strong modeling and data skills.&lt;/strong&gt; You can effortlessly translate business concepts to well structured spreadsheet models, and are excited to learn new analytical tools and generate insights through data. Familiarity with SQL/database concepts as well as modern BI tools (e.g. Looker, Pigment) is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention to detail and strong strategic instincts.&lt;/strong&gt; You are meticulous in ensuring your and others’ output is precise and error-free, but pair this with a strong sense for 80/20 to know when things “pass the smell test” and what is critical vs. secondary to an answer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growth mindset and comfort with ambiguity.&lt;/strong&gt; You are comfortable working in a fast-paced startup environment that will require you to create structure out of ambiguity, manage often competing priorities, and pivot quickly when circumstances change.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication and partnership skills.&lt;/strong&gt; You can effectively engage with a diverse array of stakeholders ranging from sales reps to engineers, and build the credibility, relationships, and buy-in necessary to strike the delicate balance between partnering and constructive challenging that this role requires. Fantastic written and verbal communication skills are a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team player with a low “ego to smarts ratio”.&lt;/strong&gt; You bring a positive, learn-it-all (not know-it-all) energy to your teams, and are generally known for being great to work with. Life is short… we want to enjoy the time we spend with our colleagues!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be willing and able to work onsite five days per week.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Employee Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Verkada is committed to fostering a workplace environment that prioritizes the holistic health and wellbeing of our employees and their families by offering comprehensive wellness perks, benefits, and resources.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Data Scientist II to join Coinbase’s Platform Data Science team. Platform data scientists partner with product, engineering, and design to improve the core systems and user journeys that power Coinbase spanning areas like Payments, Risk &amp;amp; Trust, Identity &amp;amp; Onboarding, Compliance, Customer Support, and Experimentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Data Scientist II on Platform, you’ll work on high-impact, cross-functional problems where the goal is to make Coinbase safer, more reliable, and easier to use, while unlocking growth through better decision-making and measurement. Sample projects include diagnosing funnel drop-offs and reliability issues across critical user journeys (e.g., onboarding, payments, authentication), designing north star + guardrail + diagnostic metric systems and running and improving experimentation and causal inference approaches (A/B tests, quasi-experiments, incrementality measurement).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we look for in you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in data analyses using SQL.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in programming/modeling in Python.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Applying for a specific role does not guarantee consideration for that exact position.

    "job_description": "ABOUT US:\n\nNotion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.\n\nIn-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\nMobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create their own tools, we'll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive mobile experience: that's our guiding light, and we need Android engineers to make it a reality.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE:\n\nThe Mobile Platform team’s mission is to deliver a best-in-class mobile app by making it easy to build high-quality, performant features.\n\n - You'll help mobile product teams by developing services, frameworks, and shared UI components. You’ll set the direction for how features should be built on Android.\n\n - We value building high quality apps. You'll improve the performance, reliability, and polish of our Android app.\n\n - You’ll drive developer velocity through improvements to our builds systems, mobile CI/CD, and the release process.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU'LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n\n - Ability to ship quality apps at scale: You can work with a team to build and maintain quality Android apps for a large audience. You understand the practices put in place to scale an Android engineering team.\n\n - Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n\n - Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n\n - Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\n - You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver better results. Ideally, you are comfortable using tools like Claude Code or Codex.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES:\n\n - You're proficient with the technologies we rely on: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Circuit, and open to occasionally working in Rust or Typescript.\n\n - You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\n - You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

    "job_description": "&lt;p&gt;Software is eating the world, but AI is eating software. We live in unprecedented times – AI has the potential to exponentially augment human intelligence. Every person will have a personal tutor, coach, assistant, personal shopper, travel guide, and therapist throughout life. As the world adjusts to this new reality, leading platform companies are scrambling to build LLMs at billion scale, while large enterprises figure out how to add it to their products. To make them safe, aligned and actually useful, these models need human eval and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) during pre-training, fine-tuning, and production evaluations. This is the main innovation that’s enabled ChatGPT to get such a large headstart among competition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Scale, our products include the Generative AI Data Engine, SGP, Donovan, and others that power the most advanced LLMs and generative models in the world through world-class RLHF, human data generation, model evaluation, safety, and alignment. The data we are producing is some of the most important work for how humanity will interact with AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the foundation of these products is the Platform Engineering team. In this role, you will support the design and development of shared platforms used across Scale. This includes designing our foundational data platforms and lifecycle, architecting Scale’s core cloud infrastructure and orchestration stack, and redefining how engineers develop, build, test, and deploy software at Scale.

This agent employs a multi-agent architecture for robust fact-checking, integrates several internal MCP tools, and processes complex, unstructured data sources. This solution reliably saves employees hundreds of hours weekly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Churn Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working with a TelCo organization, we built a model utilizing customer data to predict churn likelihood. The system then curates personalized offers based on this prediction. This model was integrated into a &quot;next best action&quot; copilot, enabling call center agents to proactively surface relevant offers to customers, leading to a significant reduction in churn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction Voice Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We partnered with a healthcare organization to create a lifelike voice agent and avatar designed to gather unstructured health information from patients. Engineered for low latency, the agent adeptly manages conversational flow, adheres to safety guardrails, and efficiently handles data extraction. This automation saves the organization&#39;s nurses hundreds of hours each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compensation packages at Scale for eligible roles include base salary, equity, and benefits.

    "job_description": "About the Team\nThe Knowledge Innovation team is scaling OpenAI with OpenAI. We are building a model powered knowledge system that evolves and learns as our products, systems and customers evolve. We leverage our state of the art models, technologies, and products (some external, some still in the lab) to assist or completely automate robust operations supporting both internal and external customers. We support OpenAI customers and internal partners globally, powering systems from customer support to integrity to product insights. We are a self-contained multi-disciplinary team, who enjoy a lightning fast feedback loop with customers at scale, some of whom sit just a few pods away. We iterate fast, and engineer for reliable long-term impact. We're constantly looking for the similarities and patterns in different types of work, and focus on building simple primitives, to apply world class knowledge to many domains.\n\n\nThe work of this team exemplifies use of OpenAI technologies. We build systems so everyone can see the leverage that is possible with well designed AI-based implementations. We do this by working through internal use cases focused on Customers (specifically knowledge systems, automation systems, and automated agent systems) to prove impact, then we scale.\n\n\nAbout the Role\nWe’re looking for a Backend Software Engineer to help architect and scale the infrastructure that powers our knowledge systems. This is a deeply technical and highly cross-functional role where you’ll build robust systems and backend services that serve as the foundation for how knowledge is created, accessed, and applied across OpenAI.\n\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Design, build, and maintain backend services and APIs to support intelligent automation and knowledge systems\n\n - Integrate and structure data across internal platforms, transforming it into formats optimized for use by downstream systems and AI workflows.\n\n - Collaborate closely with product, research, and engineering teams to integrate OpenAI models into high-leverage workflows\n\n - Own the full development lifecycle of new backend systems and internal platform capabilities\n\n - Build with scale and maintainability in mind, while rapidly iterating on new ideas\n   \n\nYou might be a great fit if you have:\n\n - 4+ years of backend engineering experience at product-driven companies (excluding internships)\n\n - Proficiency in backend technologies. Our tech stack includes Python, FastAPI, and Postgres\n\n - Experience designing and scaling distributed systems, APIs, or data processing pipelines\n\n - A pragmatic mindset.

You’ll partner closely with Product, Security, Trust & Safety, Research, and other engineers to deliver high-quality developer experiences and expand what ChatGPT Apps can do.\n\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Build and ship mission-critical features in the ChatGPT Apps SDK and broader platform.\n\n - Collaborate with Product Management, Security, Trust & Safety, Research, and Engineering to design and deliver developer-first experiences.\n\n - Own features end-to-end: from early design and technical direction through implementation, launch, and iteration.\n\n - Build scalable services and APIs, and develop polished UI surfaces that support publishing, discovery, and app capabilities.\n\n - Help set enduring technical direction—shipping foundations that become new product areas over time.\n\n - Contribute to team best practices in testing, architecture, and overall SDLC quality.\n   \n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE HERE IF YOU\n\n - You’re a true full-stack engineer—comfortable moving between frontend and backend to deliver complete features (React/Python are a bonus, not required).\n\n - You’ve built developer tools or platforms (SDKs, integrations like Slack apps, open source libraries, or experience at developer-tooling companies).\n\n - You’re product-oriented and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional partners to shape great user/developer experiences.\n\n - You like shipping quickly without compromising quality, security, or performance.\n\n - You’re excited to build foundational platform capabilities that will scale with a rapidly growing ecosystem.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products.

    "job_description": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nWe’re a small, fast-moving team building a new initiative at the intersection of software and systems, with close collaboration across product and infrastructure. We operate like a startup inside the organization: high ownership, tight feedback loops, and an emphasis on shipping real systems that work end-to-end. We partner closely across research, product, and engineering to turn early concepts into reliable, production-grade capabilities.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nAs a Software Engineer on this team, you will design and build the software foundations that connect products, data, and internal workflows. You’ll work across systems, tooling, infrastructure, and product surfaces to make ambitious prototypes real, scalable, and robust.\n\nYou’ll have broad scope and meaningful influence: defining architecture, making build-vs-buy decisions, improving developer velocity, and helping take a project from early exploration to deployment and launch.\n\n\nYOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR:\n\n - Building and owning core software components, from prototype through production.\n\n - Driving technical design, implementation, deployment, and launch of key systems and services.\n\n - Developing infrastructure and tooling that supports internal development workflows (e.g., data pipelines, evaluation, experiment tooling).\n\n - Integrating software across systems, ensuring reliability, performance, and observability.\n\n - Establishing pragmatic engineering standards (testing, CI/CD, release processes, operational playbooks) that enable rapid iteration without sacrificing quality.\n\n - Troubleshooting complex end-to-end issues across system boundaries and improving system debuggability.\n\n - Collaborating closely with cross-functional partners, communicating tradeoffs, and unblocking progress with a bias toward action.\n\n\nWE’RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH:\n\n - Extreme agency: you identify the highest-leverage problems and move them forward with minimal direction.\n\n - Creativity and a founder mentality: you enjoy turning ambiguity into a concrete plan and shipping outcomes.\n\n - Strong technical foundation and can make good architectural decisions under real constraints.\n\n - A high bar for quality and details, especially around reliability, maintainability, and user/developer experience.\n\n - Strong prioritization: you know when to go deep, when to simplify, and when to ship.\n\n - Strong software engineering experience building and shipping production systems.\n\n - Proficiency in at least one systems/product language (e.g., Python, C++, Rust, Go) and comfort learning new stacks.\n\n - Experience designing APIs/services and working with distributed systems, performance, or reliability concerns.\n\n - Track record of owning projects end-to-end: design → implementation → deployment → operations.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
