It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences — focusing on raising the floor for those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our Beneficial Deployments team, focused on maximizing the impact of Claude in the life sciences. Our goal is ambitious: accelerate scientific progress from R&amp;amp;D through translation by an order of magnitude. That means making Claude the go-to tool for the life sciences ecosystem from early discovery in academia to paradigm shifting biotech to reimaging pharma pipelines&amp;nbsp; — and building the technical infrastructure to back that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll work directly with flagship research partners like Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Allen Institute, embedded in their scientific workflows. This isn&#39;t consulting from the outside — you&#39;ll be building alongside their engineers, prototyping agents that fit into real research pipelines, and developing the ecosystem-level tooling (MCP servers, benchmarks, reusable agent skills) that extends Claude&#39;s usefulness across the broader life sciences community. This role will be part of the founding Beneficial Deployments applied AI team focused on bringing more of life sciences closer to the frontier and be responsible for building with our partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner deeply with flagship life sciences research institutions — understand their scientific workflows end-to-end, build hands-on with their engineering teams, and help take projects from early exploration to production systems integrated into how they do science day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop reusable ecosystem infrastructure, like MCP servers for domain-specific data sources (genomics platforms, literature databases, experimental repositories), instruments, scientifically-grounded benchmarks, and agent skills that other institutions can adopt without starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Identify what&#39;s actually hard about deploying AI in life sciences (heterogeneous data, auditability requirements, the prototype-to-trust gap) and feed those findings back to product, engineering, and research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create technical content and documentation that lets partners self-serve, so what works for one institution can scale globally without the same level of hand-holding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4+ years as a Software Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineer, or technical founder — with production experience shipping systems that real users depend on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Deep research experience in life sciences, biomedical research, or scientific computing.

You&#39;ll work on questions like: How do we measure whether a model is safe? How do we create evaluations that reflect real-world usage rather than synthetic benchmarks? How do we know our graders are accurate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of applied ML research and engineering. You&#39;ll design experiments to improve how we evaluate model behavior, then ship those methods into pipelines that inform model training and deployment decisions.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s Reinforcement Learning organization leads the research and development that trains Claude to be capable, reliable, and safe. We&#39;ve contributed to every Claude model, with significant impacts on the autonomy and coding capabilities of our most advanced models. Our work spans developing systems that enable models to use computers effectively, advancing code generation through reinforcement learning, pioneering fundamental RL research for large language models, and building scalable training methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RL org is organized around four key goals: solving the science of long-horizon tasks and continual learning, scaling RL data and environments to be comprehensive and diverse, automating software engineering end-to-end, and training the frontier production model. We collaborate closely with Anthropic&#39;s alignment and safety teams to ensure our systems are both capable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineering teams build the environments, evaluation systems, data pipelines, and tooling that make all of this possible: from realistic agentic training environments and scalable code data generation, to human data collection platforms and production training operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Full-Stack Software Engineer within Reinforcement Learning, you&#39;ll build the platforms, tools, and interfaces that power RL environment creation, data collection, and training observability. Our ability to train frontier models depends on generating diverse, high-quality training data — and the products you build are what make that possible for researchers, vendors, and data labelers alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a software engineering role embedded within research teams. You&#39;ll own product surfaces end-to-end — from backend services and APIs to web UIs that internal researchers, external vendors, and data labelers rely on daily. You don&#39;t need a background in ML research — what matters is strong full-stack engineering skills and the ability to build polished, reliable products in a fast-moving environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and extend web platforms for RL environment creation, management, and quality review — including environment configuration, versioning, and validation workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop vendor-facing interfaces and tooling that enable external partners to create, submit, and iterate on training environments with minimal friction&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement platforms for human data collection at scale, including labeling workflows, quality assurance systems, and feedback mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build evaluation dashboards and observability UIs that give researchers real-time insight into environment quality, training run health, and reward signal integrity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create backend services and APIs that connect environment authoring tools, data collection systems, and RL training infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and expand scalable code data generation pipelines, creating diverse programming tasks with robust reward signals across languages and difficulty levels&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop onboarding automation and documentation tooling so new vendors and internal users can ramp up quickly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate with RL researchers, data operations, and vendor management teams to translate their needs into well-designed product experiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have strong software engineering fundamentals with full-stack experience&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are proficient in Python and modern web frameworks (React, TypeScript, or similar)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience building and shipping user-facing products, internal tools, or developer platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can own a product surface end-to-end — backend, frontend, API design, database schema&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience with relational databases, API design patterns, and authentication/authorization systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about UX and can build interfaces that are intuitive for both technical and non-technical users&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Communicate clearly with researchers, operations teams, and engineers and can translate ambiguous requirements into well-scoped work&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are motivated by building excellent platforms&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Operate with high agency: you

regularly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about Anthropic&#39;s mission to build safe, beneficial AI and want your work to contribute to that

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s ML Performance and Scaling team trains our production pretrained models, work that directly shapes the company&#39;s future and our mission to build safe, beneficial AI systems. As a Research Engineer on this team, you&#39;ll ensure our frontier models train reliably, efficiently, and at scale. This is demanding, high-impact work that requires both deep technical expertise and a genuine passion for the craft of large-scale ML systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role lives at the boundary between research and engineering. You&#39;ll work across our entire production training stack: performance optimization, hardware debugging, experimental design, and launch coordination. During launches, the team works in tight lockstep, responding to production issues that can&#39;t wait for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own critical aspects of our production pretraining pipeline, including model operations, performance optimization, observability, and reliability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Debug and resolve complex issues across the full stack—from hardware errors and networking to training dynamics and evaluation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and run experiments to improve training efficiency, reduce step time, increase uptime, and enhance model performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Respond to on-call incidents during model launches, diagnosing problems quickly and coordinating solutions across teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain production logging, monitoring dashboards, and evaluation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add new capabilities to the training codebase, such as long context support or novel architectures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with teammates across SF and London, as well as with Tokens, Architectures, and Systems teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the team&#39;s institutional knowledge by documenting systems, debugging approaches, and lessons learned&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have hands-on experience training large language models, or deep expertise with JAX, TPU, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work—you&#39;d describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are excited about being on-call for production systems, working long days during launches, and solving hard problems under pressure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive when working on whatever is most impactful, even if that changes day-to-day based on what the production model needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excel at debugging complex, ambiguous problems across multiple layers of the stack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively, especially when coordinating across time zones or during high-stress incidents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about the work itself and want to refine your craft as a research engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care about the societal impacts of AI and responsible scaling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Previous experience training LLM’s or working extensively with JAX/TPU, PyTorch, or other ML frameworks at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributed to open-source LLM frameworks (e.g., open_lm, llm-foundry, mesh-transformer-jax)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Published research on model training, scaling laws, or ML systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with production ML systems, observability tools, or evaluation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background as a systems engineer, quant, or in other roles requiring both technical depth and operational excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes This Role Unique:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a typical research engineering role. The work is highly operational—you&#39;ll be deeply involved in keeping our production models training smoothly, which means being responsive to incidents, flexible about priorities, and comfortable with uncertainty. During launches, the team often works extended hours and may need to respond to issues on evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, this operational intensity comes with extraordinary learning opportunities. You&#39;ll gain hands-on experience with some of the largest, most sophisticated training runs in the industry. You&#39;ll work alongside world-class researchers and engineers, and the institutional knowledge you build will compound in ways that can&#39;t be easily transferred. For people who thrive on this type of work, it&#39;s uniquely rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re building a close-knit team of people who genuinely care about doing excellent work together.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, Anthropic is growing fast. Really, really fast. The People Products team exists to support Anthropic’s mission by defining the blueprint for AI at work. We help hire the best person in the world for every job, ensure manager effectiveness, ramp new hires successfully, and ensure that we apply first principles thinking in how we shape Anthropic’s culture through the tools we build. We cover the entire employee lifecycle from hiring to onboarding, teamwork, and promotions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work directly with Claude, with access to capabilities no external team has, on problems that are genuinely unsolved. You’ll move fast — prototype to production in days or weeks. We believe in cross-functional thinkers who can reason across product, design, and engineering. You’ll be given high autonomy, own your decisions, and ship constantly. If you’ve experienced the pain of bad people practices and want to be the person who fixes them at the most consequential AI company in the world, this is that job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build full-stack end-to-end across the People Products portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement AI-native workflows: build tools, evals, prompts, and products. You’ll help define what is possible in applied AI for people processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work directly with internal stakeholders — HR teams, recruiters, managers — to understand problems, gather feedback, and iterate quickly without waiting for requirements to be handed down. No gatekeeping, you are expected to talk to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product and architecture decisions independently in a low-structure environment: knowing when to cut scope, when to ship, and when to ask for input.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contribute ideas for how the team works, what it builds, and where applied AI can have the most leverage in people workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Derive joy from hard work and the act of creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have shipped LLM-native features or applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are experienced enough to build big features independently, and make great architectural decisions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are self-sufficient end-to-end: you can go from idea to production without needing a designer, PM, or architect to unblock you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Move fast without cutting corners: you hold a high quality bar and know how to make smart tradeoffs under time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engage directly with users and criticism: you’re comfortable talking to internal customers, hearing hard feedback, and incorporating it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are genuinely mission-driven: you care about the intersection of AI and people practices, not just the technical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are a collaborative, supportive teammate: you bring people along, communicate clearly about tradeoffs, and make the people around you better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with MCP (Model Context Protocol) or prior experience building Claude or LLM integrations in production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background at an AI-native company or in a product-focused 0-&amp;gt;1 engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with HR tech platforms such as Greenhouse, Workday, or Rippling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses.

Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone&#39;s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stripe is beloved by developers for the simplicity of our APIs, the thoroughness of our documentation, and our focus on developer experience. The Technical Solutions Engineering (TSE) team is the glue that supports our developer-users and champions developer experience as being central to the overall experience of our users. TSE interacts directly with developer-users more than any other team at Stripe, so your role will have a significant impact on what Stripe is known for and values most. When we do our job well, developers all over the world are able to smoothly launch and grow their businesses on Stripe, whether they’re integrating payments for the first time or building complex financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;TSEs understand the fundamentals of programming incredibly well and eagerly jump in and familiarize themselves with others’ code. You will do a wide variety of things, including explaining technical concepts about Stripe’s products, build and debug integrations with developers, and produce/improve guides that help our users solve particular problems to be successful with Stripe. You will interact with developers of all skill levels through a variety of mediums, enabling them to be successful when using Stripe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Early on, current team members will devote a large amount of time to teaching you and helping you get to a level of comfort and expertise with Stripe, its services, and how we interact with users. Later, we’d love for you to take on this role with others on the team and Stripes broadly, as teaching is a great way to learn and to reinforce what you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re someone who enjoys working with all kinds of code, is a fast researcher, a strong writer, and enthusiastic about helping others build mission-critical products with Stripe, we want to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate with a number of external developers and aid them in building their applications against Stripe’s infrastructure in a number of programming languages (including Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, NodeJS, .NET, ReactJS, React Native, Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Java for Android).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unblock external developers with their thorniest integration challenges through a variety of support channels including email, ticketing software, internal issue trackers, community platforms (like StackOverflow), and real-time chat software (like Slack and Discord)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain internal and external documentation, examples, integration demos, and code-snippets that demonstrate usage patterns of the Stripe infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify points of friction developers encounter and collaborate with engineering teams to make Stripe products better.

As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-sheets-root=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you&#39;re building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Full Stack Engineer to build the Vercel Dashboard, the control plane for every Vercel user. You&#39;ll own the core surface through which developers and teams interact with Vercel, from first login through daily use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard is where the self-driving aspect of Vercel&#39;s Cloud comes to life. Today, it&#39;s a project listing page. We&#39;re turning it into a personalized, agent-powered surface that proactively helps users ship and stay on best practices. This is a foundational role: you&#39;ll be one of the first engineers on a new team, working alongside our current tech lead to rearchitect and rebuild the Dashboard from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll work across the stack: building fast, polished UI on the frontend and the APIs, data layers, and services that power personalization, agent experiences, and real-time push surfaces on the backend. The Dashboard must be the reference implementation of Vercel&#39;s own platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and own core Dashboard infrastructure: the shell, navigation, layout system, and shared components that every product area builds within&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect and implement the backend services and APIs that power the Dashboard, including personalization, notifications, and agent-powered experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive performance as a core feature. Profile, measure, and optimize aggressively. Every interaction should feel instant&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build agent-facing surfaces: the UI and API layers where agents surface errors, suggest fixes, update config, and keep users on best practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product area teams (Billing, CI/CD, Observability, etc.) to ensure their pages integrate cleanly into the Dashboard shell and follow shared patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship incrementally and continuously.

You&#39;re strong across the stack: modern frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and backend (APIs, databases, services)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ve built products for developers or technical users. You understand the expectations of this audience and you hold yourself to the same bar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You think in systems. You naturally build reusable abstractions, composable components, and clean APIs rather than one-off solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re comfortable with ambiguity. This is a new team building a new product direction. You can take a rough problem statement and turn it into shipped code&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You use AI tools in your own development workflow and have opinions on how they should work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You ship fast without sacrificing quality. You bias toward iteration and production feedback over long planning cycles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate clearly and collaborate well with Product, Design, and other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working on platform or horizontal teams where you built shared infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open source projects, especially in the React or Next.js ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $196,000-$294,000. Actual salary will be based on job-related skills, experience, and location. Compensation outside of San Francisco may be adjusted based on employee location.

A leader in cloud physical security, Verkada helps organizations strengthen safety and efficiency through one connected software platform that includes solutions for video security, access control, air quality sensors, alarms, intercoms, and visitor management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 30,000 organizations worldwide, including more than 100 companies in the Fortune 500, trust Verkada as their physical security layer for easier management, intelligent control, and scalable deployments. Founded in 2016, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting opportunity to join the Corporate Development team at a high-growth pre-IPO startup. As a key member of a small (but mighty) team supporting over 2,000 colleagues, you will be a key player in evaluating and executing M&amp;amp;A opportunities and supporting strategic finance special projects. This role will partner cross-functionally as a trusted advisor to various leaders and teams across Verkada to drive inorganic growth opportunities (including M&amp;amp;A and partnerships), as well as organic strategic initiatives, while maintaining operational excellence, helping us reach the next level of scale and operating sophistication in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct market research and competitive analysis to identify industry trends, potential acquisition targets, and partnership opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in due diligence processes, including data analysis, financial review, and coordination with cross-functional teams (Finance, Product, Legal, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track and analyze key performance indicators for strategic projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare summaries, reports, and updates for senior leadership and executive team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to strategic finance special projects as needed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-4+ years of top tier professional experience.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re coming to us from a Strategic Finance, Business Operations, FP&amp;amp;A, or other highly analytical role at a fast growing startup, and may have begun your career in investing, management consulting, and/or investment banking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High analytical horsepower paired with strong modeling and data skills.&lt;/strong&gt; You can effortlessly translate business concepts to well structured spreadsheet models, and are excited to learn new analytical tools and generate insights through data. Familiarity with SQL/database concepts as well as modern BI tools (e.g. Looker, Pigment) is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention to detail and strong strategic instincts.&lt;/strong&gt; You are meticulous in ensuring your and others’ output is precise and error-free, but pair this with a strong sense for 80/20 to know when things “pass the smell test” and what is critical vs. secondary to an answer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growth mindset and comfort with ambiguity.&lt;/strong&gt; You are comfortable working in a fast-paced startup environment that will require you to create structure out of ambiguity, manage often competing priorities, and pivot quickly when circumstances change.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication and partnership skills.&lt;/strong&gt; You can effectively engage with a diverse array of stakeholders ranging from sales reps to engineers, and build the credibility, relationships, and buy-in necessary to strike the delicate balance between partnering and constructive challenging that this role requires. Fantastic written and verbal communication skills are a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team player with a low “ego to smarts ratio”.&lt;/strong&gt; You bring a positive, learn-it-all (not know-it-all) energy to your teams, and are generally known for being great to work with.

A leader in cloud physical security, Verkada helps organizations strengthen safety and efficiency through one connected software platform that includes solutions for video security, access control, air quality sensors, alarms, intercoms, and visitor management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 30,000 organizations worldwide, including more than 100 companies in the Fortune 500, trust Verkada as their physical security layer for easier management, intelligent control, and scalable deployments. Founded in 2016, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As a member of our Sales Strategy and Operations team, you will have an integral role in driving the insights, operations, and strategy that enables Sales to run better, faster, and smarter. Sales Strategy and Operations is an excellent platform to learn how a business really runs.&amp;nbsp; Prior candidates that our leadership team has worked with have gone on to be VPs and COOs of companies.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;You will be joining the Sales Strategy and Operations team as a high impact contributor, gaining exposure to a wide variety of challenges, processes, and data that makes the engine of this Sales organization hum. As an Associate on the team, you will lead cross-functional initiatives from ideation to analytics to recommendations to drive impact across the sales organization.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strategy &amp;amp; planning: pulling ongoing and ad hoc reporting for weekly / quarterly business reviews, and providing insights to inform business decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Systems and operations: identifying and implementing improvements in current workflows and processes that can help improve efficiency and visibility - this might be in &lt;a class=&quot;postings-link&quot; href=&quot;http://salesforce.com/&quot;&gt;Salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt; or other tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sales Enablement: building programming and content to help new hires get up to speed as quickly as possible, as well as tracking the right effectiveness metrics to see what makes someone a top (or bottom) performer and how we scale those learnings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since we&#39;re still in scrappy startup mode, there&#39;s a lot of rolling up your sleeves and getting into the weeds to drive direct impact on a daily basis. We knock out today&#39;s problems while also balancing our need to build for the long-term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ll be working in Salesforce and Google Sheets / Excel on a daily basis, while also talking frequently with our stakeholders in sales, marketing, ops, product, finance, and more to help troubleshoot systems issues, review insights from our analyses, and build future-state processes and systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High-impact self-starter: you take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance. You’re excited by the possibility of leading cross-functional workstreams and generating buy-in among senior leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Raw smarts: we are looking for people who can look at complex problems and solve them start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Excel skills are a must; SQL / Tableau / Looker experience a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Process and operational thinking: you can tackle a problem independently and quickly iterate to a solution, and then also document it in a way that&#39;s easy to understand for all audiences. Previous Salesforce experience is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communication and stakeholder management: you&#39;ll need to be able to connect with sales reps and hardware engineers alike to figure out how we build the right processes and workflows to drive efficiency while also giving us the data to measure how we&#39;re doing. Strong written and verbal communication skills are a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexibility and hustle: you manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You��re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of professional experience, ideally in consulting, banking, private equity, corporate strategy, or a startup. Bachelors or masters from a top school preferred.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Previous Sales, Sales Operations, or Strategy experience is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be willing and able to work onsite five days per week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Employee Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Verkada is committed to fostering a workplace environment that prioritizes the holistic health and wellbeing of our employees and their families by offering comprehensive wellness perks, benefits, and resources.

Startups move faster than ever—what used to take years now happens in days—and the decisions founders make early can either unlock scale or become long-term constraints. We partner with startups at the critical moments where technical, commercial, and strategic support starts to matter most.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re a talent-dense team made up of former founders, engineers, and experienced go-to-market operators who bring firsthand experience building, scaling, and supporting modern software companies. Many of us have sat on the other side of the table, making architectural decisions, navigating tradeoffs, and scaling under real constraints, and we bring that perspective into every customer interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We operate with a growth mindset and strong shared ownership. We dig deep to understand our customers, work closely across functions as one team, and find ways to win even when the path forward isn’t obvious. Resilience, curiosity, and a willingness to push through hard problems are table stakes here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a team for people who want to operate with high trust, high agency, and high impact — alongside peers who care deeply about helping startups succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are an expert in Vercel, you have incredible pattern recognition, and are at the bleeding edge of the tech and tools defining how we live and work. In this role, you&#39;ll help startups unlock Vercel&#39;s full value from adoption through scaling—building relationships with founders and technical leaders who are making critical architectural decisions. You&#39;ll analyze usage patterns to identify expansion opportunities, coordinate cross-functional teams to drive outcomes, and guide teams as they adopt AI-native architectures. By leveraging automation and AI to maximize your impact, you&#39;ll help refine early plays into repeatable playbooks that scale across our startup portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re based within commuting distance of our London office, the role includes in-office anchor days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build trusted relationships with founders, developers, and technical leaders by quickly developing deep understanding of their architecture, use cases, and technical constraints&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Landing new logos, driving early activation, and making Vercel the default choice before competitors get in&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Driving first activation, earning trust fast, and positioning Vercel as the obvious default stack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Focus on pipeline generation, outbound, identifying high-potential startups early&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with founders and developers as they adopt AI-native features and architectures, helping them understand how Vercel’s Frontend Cloud fits into a rapidly evolving developer ecosystem and supports new workloads, performance requirements, and scaling patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use automation, agents, and self-built workflows to operate at high leverage and focus time and energy on the most impactful customer work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operate comfortably in an evolving environment, helping refine early motions and turn what works into repeatable playbooks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who sits at the intersection of technical curiosity, commercial excellence, and startup mindset.
